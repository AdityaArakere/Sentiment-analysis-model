One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode youll be hooked They are right as this is exactly what happened with mebr br The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word GO Trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence Its is hardcore in the classic use of the wordbr br It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary It focuses mainly on Emerald City an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda Em City is home to manyAryans Muslims gangstas Latinos Christians Italians Irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far awaybr br I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceOZ doesnt mess around The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal I couldnt say I was ready for it but as I watched more I developed a taste for Oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence Not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience Watching Oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side,1
A wonderful little production br br The filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimeBBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece br br The actors are extremely well chosen Michael Sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life br br The realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears It plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with Halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done,1
I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2 Risk Addiction I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to lovebr br This was the most Id laughed at one of Woodys comedies in years dare I say a decade While Ive never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young womanbr br This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends,1
Petter Matteis Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch Mr Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter br br This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact Stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitatbr br The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounterbr br The acting is good under Mr Matteis direction Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson Carol Kane Michael Imperioli Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alivebr br We wish Mr Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work,1
Probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring It just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years Paul Lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight The kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch And the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling If I had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie,1
I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in meI grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my heros every weekYou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntWe need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventureOh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many moviesSo any ole way I believe Ive got what I wanna sayWould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntIf my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitIf this is so then I must go so lets do it,1

This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous One of the actors is george clooney and Im not a fan but this roll is not bad Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack The man of constant sorrow I recommand this movie to everybody Greetings Bart,1
Some films just simply should not be remade This is one of them In and of itself it is not a bad film But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of Owen Wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more,1
I remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my Dad took me my brother sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me knowThe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it,1
After the success of Die Hard and its sequels its no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of Die Hard on a movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept That is what they did with Cliffhanger Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly Stop or My Mom Will Shoot Stallones careerbr br Cliffhanger is one big nitpickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing basejumping aviation facial expressions acting skills All in all its full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk Stallone even managed to get outacted by a horse However if you an forget all the nonsense its actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughsbr br Youve got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent Rex Linn as Traversbr br He may of been Henry in Portrait of a Serial Killer but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringeworthy performance as Hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody And whilst he surely cant be it really does look like Ralph Waites Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her deathbr br Mention too must go to former Londons Burning actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football yes you cant help enjoy that bit Hal needed a good kickingbr br So forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy And if youre looking for Qaulen hes the one wearing the helicopter,1
What an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you wont regret it its too much fun Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt anything more other than him I still liked it The music by ARRehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it,1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenters complex life Though it fails in giving accurate facts and detailsbr br Cynthia Gibb portrays Karen was not a fine election She is a good actress but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter I think that the role needed a stronger character Someone with a stronger personalitybr br Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific she does a great job as Karens motherbr br It has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album Unfortunately they werent though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries,1
The Cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations This is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent This is the best movie of the year to datebr br Ive read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point This movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow The Cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we dont want any more Personally I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge himbr br Weve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes I do agree that the genre is a bit overworked The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed But The Cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studiedbr br I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another Instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity The Cell wants to let you see what its all about and not how its all about and I guess thats what some people dont like True I do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it inbr br I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another Nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing I wouldnt be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like If it were up to me itd at least get nominated for best picturebr br Ive noticed that Ive kind of been repeating myself Not because theres nothing else to say but because I cant stress enough how fantastic I thought The Cell was If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured a good time I guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley Leaving the theater I heard one audience member say Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs If so I want what he was smokingbr br out of 4,1
War movie is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat Once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen The Civil Warera Cold Mountain starring Jude Law Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a filmbr br Then again calling Cold Mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate True enough the film opens with a quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that puts Glory director Edward Zwick shame However Cold Mountain is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman played by Jude Law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind Ada Monroe played by Nicole Kidman At first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldiers tribulations on the battlefield Indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrivedbr br Cold Mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward Meanwhile back at the farm Adas cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast Coming to Adas rescue is the course toughasnails Ruby Thewes played by Renée Zellweger who helps Ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Adabr br Within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the wartorn South unfolds The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Rubys deadbeat father Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother All have been greatly affected and changed by the war of Northern aggression mostly for the worse The dark pervading antiwar message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century its hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevantbr br Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plotbr br Make no mistake Cold Mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether,1
Taut and organically gripping Edward Dmytryks Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cyclebr br Bivouacked in Washington DC a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars Three of them end up at a strangers apartment where Robert Ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host Sam Levene to death because he happens to be Jewish Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum whos assigned to Ryans outfit Suspicion falls on the second of the three George Cooper who has vanished Ryan slays the third buddy Steve Brodie to insure his silence before Young closes inbr br Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs Ryan naturally does his prototypical Angry White Male and to the hilt while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central Young may never have been better Gloria Grahame gives her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life Paul Kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorablebr br The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but its pretty much confined to Youngs reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit At least theres no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why Ryan hates Jews and hillbillies andbr br Curiously Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it the novel its based on Richard Brooks The Brick Foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale News of the Holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antiSemitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyerbr br But while the change from homophobia to antiSemitism works in general the specifics dont fit so smoothly The victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since theres a girlfriend in tow It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating Ryans murderous rage,1

One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman Titta Di Girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy When were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italianspeaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous He says you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth Having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamos troubles br br This initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about At one point in his nonlife Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous The first half of the film may be described as slow by some It does indeed reveal Di Girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details However scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes The existence of Titta Di Girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out br br Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dellAmore or LImbalsamatore Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia Not unlike The Machinist and in a far more explicit way the Al Pacino film Insomnia Le Conseguenze dellAmore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one br br The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia played by Olivia Magnani granddaughter of the legendary Anna and the memory of Tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again Though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations Le Conseguenze dellAmore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postinolike fare more La Vita è Bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dellAmore LImbalsamatore and others Your loss world,1
Okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again Week in week out David Morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle but whats wrong with that David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by David Koepp a great writer is heavenbr br Due to the lack of love for this show by many I cant see it going to a season series but you never know The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me lets hope something good can make it past a first series,1
This movie is based on the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites a topic that comes from Hans personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China That background and the beautiful Hong Kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its timebr br Other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world The acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclinedbr br The cinematography really brings out fiftys Hong Kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments The ending is a real tearjerker Some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories this is a shining example,1
This movie struck home for me Being 29 I remember the 80s and my father working in a factory I figured if I worked hard too if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own Ive noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cant get anywherebr br I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS its made for TV and I just saw it an hour ago Ic ant find it anywhere Id love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished I think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas,1
As a disclaimer Ive seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and I only just saw the musical this week This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasnt in the musical however it tainted me when I watched the musical br br I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role along with Kasey I think her Let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course The decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical,1
Preston Sturgis THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kaels THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis screenplay here As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site Kael overstated her casebr br There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane the newsreel representing Ralston the Henry Luce clone Thatchers memoirs Bernstein Jed Leland Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the butler Each has his or her different slant on Kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kanes story This method also leads to frequent overlapping retellings of the same incidentbr br This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY Yes like KANE it is about a legendary business leader here it is Tom Garner Spencer Tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country But there are only two narrators they are Garners right hand man Henry Ralph Morgan and his wife Sarah Padden This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner Henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in Henrybr br Typical example Although he worked his way up Tom becomes more and more antilabor in his later years Unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans Henry describes Toms confrontation with the Union in a major walkout and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life But Henrys wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the Unions headquarters killing many people So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure blackbr br Im not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANEs success few films do including all of Orson Welles other films but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold ones interest to the end And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought homebr br When they marry Tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had But in America great business success comes at a cost Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly But it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with Sally And he also notices Eve Helen Vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys herbr br Similarly Tom too gets a full shock which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry Eve marries Tom and presents him with a son but it turns out to be Eves son by Toms son Tom Jr Philip Trent The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himselfbr br The film is not a total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly Yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans Sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail So on the whole it is a first rate film No CITIZEN KANE perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America,1
Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic KungFu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood and the protagonist Gordon Liu the counterpart to the westerns Clint Eastwood Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest this is Presented in Shaw Scope just like the good old daysbr br This film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that erabr br Act One sets up the premise Workers in a dyemill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters They cant do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many timesbr br Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob However without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly After some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like Mr Miyagis style in Karate Kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple Nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox waybr br Act Three is where the fight fest begins With cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used adnausem in Hollywood flicks they sure dont make fight scenes like they used to Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday so if youre game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for,1

NO SPOILERSbr br After Hitchcocks successful first American film Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMariers lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period mistaken identity and espionage As the US settled into World War II and the large scale war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption wartime sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC who coauthored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcocks sensibilitiesbr br This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane Robert Cummings who while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory meets new employee Frank Frye Norman Lloydd and moments later is framed for committing sabotage Fleeing the authorities who dont believe his farfetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin Priscilla Lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with Of course in the land of Hitchcock Patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mixbr br In good form for this outing Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average Joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving Its a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of Hitchcocks more memorable finales Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the wartime shooting ban on public attractions While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcocks most well known films its a popular bmovie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual terrific Hitchcock villains Remember to look for Hitchcocks cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film Hitchcocks original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his deaf wife was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf,1
I just watched The Dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years agobr br Its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my God the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this moviebr br The Dresser is the story of Sir an aging Shakespearean actor Finney and his dresser Norman Courtenay sort of a valet putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II These are two men each dependent upon the other Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir without Sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anywaybr br This is a characterdriven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life Finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer Employer is really the wrong term to use though For although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couplebr br Yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood That is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably Eileen Atkins as the longsuffering stage manager Madge There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have beenbr br Although it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director Peter Yates and Best Adapted Screenplaybr br I had remembered this as being a good movie but I wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then I encourage you to see The Dresser,1
So lets beginbr br The movie itself is as original as Cronenbergs movies would usually appearbr br My intention to see it was certainly JJL being one of my favourite actresses She is as lovely as usual this cutiebr br I would not say it was my favourite movie of hers Still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow br br The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array br br Recommend with confidence,1
DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films and although not the typical bloodbath that Fulci is known for this is still a very unique and enjoyable filmbr br The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother An old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé a mentally handicapped townsman and a deafmute little girl All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealedbr br DONT TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a classical giallo or a typical Fulci gore film Although it does contain elements of both it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulcis later works This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end Recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of Fulcis nonsplatter films but dont despair DONT TORTURE still has more than its fair share of violence and sleaze Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one a look 8510,1
I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written Its not just about entertainment Theres tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across And yes it might be confusing to some of youespecially if you didnt watch Sepet andor Gubra for 76 timesbr br I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right Its really ironic how the characters relate Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future br br And i absolutely love the voiceovers Its crude yet awakeningly fresh Like when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard then there was suddenly Mukhsins voice saying Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the treebr br It captured Malaysians attitudeand in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character For example even the kids can be really sharp tonguedcomplete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isnt sorted out br br All i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it br br It kept me glued to the screen i couldnt even take my eyes off it Not even to make out in the cinema Ha ha,1
I am not a golf fan by any means On May 26 about 1030 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800s Old movies I like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy Harry Vardon is awaken by the voices of men He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something So then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on The movie is excellent We then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning Dont want to give away too much I was up until 2 AM This is super please see the movie,1
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century And with a cast like Shô Kasugi Christopher Lee and JohnRhys Davies it really is the perfect Badventure of all time Its actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it Even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have a modern feel It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but Im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had This on the other hand just has the real feeling You just cant hate it I think its an okay adventure movie And I really love the soundtrack Damn I want the theme song,1

This film took me by surprise I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 78 Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 79 and the critics averaged an amazing 82 If anything they UNDERRATED this little gembr br Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother Mina and less than forthcoming dad Mike I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker Mike Minas son Doug was going to take us As a matter of fact I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with thisbr br Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a mustsee even if you arent a fan of the documentary genre This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten 51 Birch Street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work BRAVO,1
Stephen Hawkings is a genius He is the king of geniuses Watching this movie makes me feel dumb But its a great movie Not highly entertaining but very very intriguing The movie centers around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings a man who makes Einstein look average and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe time the galaxy and black holes Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think theyv got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up theyll write it all down Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrigs disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen Watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes Awesome You wont be the same after you see it,1
Down Periscope has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS Since then we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Nowbr br It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offeredbr br The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession even among the very young I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile Alabama in 2002 A group of Cub Scouts my grandson among them had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on boardbr br It is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our Navy and Hollywood which is rare companybr br Thanks to Kelsey Grammar Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie such great entertainment,1
Deanna Durbin Nan Grey and Barbara Read are Three Smart Girls in this Universal film from 1936 which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences It also stars Ray Milland Mischa Auer Charles Winninger John King Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady Its a sweet story about three young women now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father Winninger is marrying again Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board a ship to America with the help of the housekeepernanny determined to stop the wedding Realizing that the intended called Precious Barnes is nothing but a golddigger aided and abetted by her mother Brady they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count This is arranged by their fathers accountant King The man he chooses is a fulltime drunk Auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count Milland What a messbr br This is a delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by Auer Milland Barnes and Brady The young women are pretty and all do good work The emphasis of course is on young Durbin who is a natural actress and a beautifullytrained singer In fact her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice She sings a delightful Il Bacio in a police stationbr br One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by Charles Winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them Barnes as the golddigger isnt all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger more glamorous woman In fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughtersbr br Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here she has the final shot in the movie Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he isbr br Very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna,1
If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England Other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with Alfred Molina Joan Plowright Polly Walker Josie Lawrence Jim Broadbent Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the major roles Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painters eye Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us,1

I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in spacebr br The story begins much like any other Mario game Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom Upon arriving at Peachs castle Mario finds Bowser and his son Bowser Jr attacking the castle with their airships Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Lumas home a floating space station here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader a woman named Rosalina Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space stations Power Stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach thus the adventure beginsbr br The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic Mario environments The best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment Then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the Wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 gamesbr br My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives Still these minor problems aside its a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging This is the type of game that weve been waiting for on the Wiibr br A perfect 10 out of 10,1
This short film that inspired the soontobe full length feature Spatula Madness is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature This films 15minute running time is absorbed by some oddball comedy and a small musical number Unfortunately not much else lies below it The plot that is set up doesnt really have time to show But its surely follows it plot better than many highbudget Hollywood films This film is worth watching at least a few times Take it for what it is and dont expect a deep story,1
I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart I am glad I did It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a moviegame remake The bonus levels were very hard The sniper one I think was too hard it made me so frustrated I didnt play the game for a week and a half There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it br br The only thing I might change was the upgrade system I didnt notice any difference from unupgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade didnt seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter I really liked the Q copter I think the developers did a good job,1

Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy Show People released by MGM in 1928 Davies plays a hick from Savannah Georgia who arrives in Hollywood with her father Dell Henderson The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot as is Davies outrageous southern costume Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines who is immediately smitten with her Well Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio High Art Studios and lands a job in stuffy period pieces A handsome but fake actor Andre Telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is Marion Davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film King Vidor This is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own A treasure of a film,1
The performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again However I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director Attenboroughs credits that puzzles me arent they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience I am hoping I would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film,1
Despite later claims this earlytalkie melodrama has very little in common with Citizen Kane Its a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat told in flashback but hopping around time The scriptwriter Preston Sturges shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of Kane are evident Still its very watchable with a young Spencer Tracy his oldman makeup makes him look just like well an old Spencer Tracy showing depth and authority and Colleen Moore a little past her prime and not physically well matched playing a multifaceted womanbehindtheman Theres also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history sending the final third into ecstatic soapopera reverberations The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets and there are some plot holes left open how would she know whose son it was if shes sleeping with both of them and the music is awfully hokey For all that I was quite fascinated,1
This is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared not handsome But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature this is the way to see it I own every copy of this movie and have read and reread the original The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this,1

The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases However there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer recruited to eliminate him It is rare that a second or third tier actor such as Quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film Usually such a role is given to an Alist actor with box office draw which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits Quinn Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent The plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as were used to seeing The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity The locations are convincing and effective The soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb andor meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video type soundtracks a villain that hams it up and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 This is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release 12 of 4 stars,1
this is one of the finest movies i have ever seenthe stark scenerythe isolationthe ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religiona backdrop for some wordliness and sophisticationthe acting is completely naturalbut for me as afoodie the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feasti have spent time in paris and know the cuisine wellwhether or not the cafe anglais really exists i dont know but i do know of similar establishments and babettes menu and choice of wines are authenticand of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could bethis is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it,1
Set in the 1794 the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton Gerard Depardieu at his finest and Robespierre a commanding performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre He is opposed to The Reign Of Terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties His previous film Man Of Iron 1981 had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski and that between Danton and Robespierre DantonWalesa are the voice of reason opposed to RobespierreJaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent The film is based on the Polish play The Danton Affair written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical But what the film does is to concentrate on the behindthescenes meetings of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris,1

Ingrid Bergman playing dentist Walter Matthaus faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss is absolutely wonderful in this film She handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk in a record booth Ingrids monologue is a front but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart Matthau is an odd choice for the leading man hes too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist but I liked the way he tries hard to please Goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie Hawn who won a Supporting Oscar is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today This bedroom farce isnt terribly sophisticated and faintly reminds one of Any Wednesday besides but its a welcome relief from the noisy teenoriented comedies they turn out today Cactus Flower is a lovely sigh from,1
This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces The Fall of the House of Usher Dance of Death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end It is similar to some of the old blackandwhite movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example The Cat and the Canary The Old Dark House Night of Terror and so on Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of lifesize dolls that terrorize the guests He dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences I wont go into too much detail here but it is definitely a mustsee for fans of old dark house mysteriesbr br Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened roombr br Dan Basinger 810,1
This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year I didnt see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department but I think this is a better put together movie It actually has a point If you are going to see a whole bunch of TA you will be disappointed Just a well put together movie If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie I definitely think that Ebert and Roepers review of this movie is right on I mean I dont really like Ebert on most movies but this is the movie that I will agree about The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie Yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny,1
I remember seeing this film in the mid 80s thought it a well paced and well acted piece I now work quite often in Berkeley Square and the had to get a copy of DVD to remind myself how little the area has changed although my office is newish it just 30 seconds away from the bank Even Jack Barclays car dealership is still there selling Bentleys and Rolls Roycesbr br Its look like the DVD is due a Region 2 release soon The region 1 copy I is very poor quality Lets hope theyve cleaned it upbr br Only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but I guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with,1
Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes 2000 Close ups predominated it Close ups of walls humans and of many other things The warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie a warm atmosphere Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie Silence and slow movements characterize the movie Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of closeups Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes The story was also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s This prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end In short I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema,1
Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a lightweight project since he pretty much has to carry it Meatballs is the story of lowrent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a twoday Olympiad competition Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debutbr br The film is sprinkled with mediumsized laughs chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while hes sleeping Morty or Micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchinessbr br The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace Of course its up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad The sentimentality of Rudys situation seems tacked on to a great degree Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just adlibbing while the cameras were rolling In other words Murray might as well have said to Makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesnt fit in But before its all over Murrays performance makes this plot device more than bearable He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeacebr br The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesnt matter This is a pretty good film on many levels Dont let the absurd 56 rating this film is currently getting scare you off Murray will keep you laughing throughout Just be warned avoid the sequels Especially the one with Corey Feldman 8 of 10 starsbr br The Hound,1
I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill Jackie Kennedys sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the Maysles to make Big Edie and Little Edie the subject of a film They certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women Id say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating ie Are they nuts Or am I missing something This movie is hard to come by Netflix does not have it Facets does though,1
I just watched this movie on its premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia I liked not loved Mork Mindy as a kid mostly for Robin Williams zany energetic performance This movie made me remember why Was the original show great Not really but Robin certainly was Which brings me to this moviebr br I was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in a way it was But of course the real focus was on Robin It was interesting to see Robins journey from struggling street jester to national tv star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr Williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it was even deadon On an unrelated note I noticed that Robins struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman who was underappreciated by network tv and held back creatively but thats the Taxi behind the scenes biopicbr br All in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan The acting was solid by all never melodramatic like I suspected and the story moved along well Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot Not a great masterpiece by any means I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber but definitely watchable especially for those Robin Williams and Mork Mindy fans out there Nanoo nanoo,1

I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 yearsold you do the math I absolutely loved it I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this 1984 was the last time I saw that film until about a month ago It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 330 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 900 am I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid br br Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that that Andie MacDowells voice was dubbed by someone else Ian Holme was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan He was great The depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazingbr br As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan but Im used to Highlander The Hunted and Fortress In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth againbr br So to make a short story way too long I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 600am to see it,1

Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married womans flight from her husbandand the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her We learn little about this womans marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late shes also recently learned shes pregnant which has further complicated her heart she doesnt want to be a complacent wifey despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone She meets two men on her journey a former college football hero whoafter an accident during a gamehas been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life The clear clean landscapes as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler are astutely realized as are the characters Shirley Knight James Caan and Robert Duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms Some scenes such as Knights first call home from a payphone or her first night alone with Caan where they play Simon Says are almost too intimate to watch Coppola toys with reality turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks weve been made privy to He allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy there are at least two or three very frisky moments Its a heady endeavorso much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later Some may shun Coppolas unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings from,1
A young girl becomes a wartime marines penpal and when he visits at wars end expecting someone a bit more available comic complications ensue All ultimately works out well naturally but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery Errol Flynns deadon impression of Humphrey Bogart from Casablanca is a highlight as are various sendups of his own swashbuckling image the jumping scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot It is Tucker though who tucks the movie under his arm lowers his head and barrels over the goal line He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in FTroop and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued and little Patti Brady charms as Tuckers actual penpal friend A fine lightweight coming home comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining,1
What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentationbr br Spoiler of sorts followsbr br Poor Cedric he apparently didnt know what hit him Poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch These two guys just didnt belong together from their first ambiguous encounter As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beachbr br On a purely technical note I loved the camera action in this film Subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my French is presque rien I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more This was a polished very professionally made motion picture Though many scenes seem superfluous I rate it nine out of ten,1

This movie was not so much promoted here in Greeceeven though it got good actors great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my Country The movie itself is very powerfulits about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his homevillage after been released from a 5yo prison timedrugs The end is rather sad Mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency 7 out of 10 because very few Greek movies can make such an impression,1

Even though Im quite young The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band I never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since I can rememberbr br Its the sort of film that is worth trying the once I can see why it wasnt released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV I was flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film it didnt much details except something like John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up Jared Harris Stars Id never heard of him he played John or Aiden Quinn who played Paul However they are certainly underestimated actorsbr br The film had a slow start but as it developed I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters As a huge fan I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennons accent personality and mannerisms spot on Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent THe makeup artists made them look excellentbr br THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A SPOILERbr br As I mentioned before it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians As for Lennons rude line in the Italian restaurant totally unnecessary The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch itbr br It is quite different from the other biographical films Ive seen where its about how The Beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well Eg Backbeatbr br In conclusion I would say if youre a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise At only about 95 minutes long its worth waiting for the film to developbr br If anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the comments page for this film Id be very interested,1
Originally I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off The POD and was rather disappointed After watching the movie my view was changed The movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that KG and Jaybles portray in the movie br br Much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies I have seen in the theaters lately ex Saw III dull and dragging Casino Royale way to homoerotic which in prior installments I have really enjoyed br br If you enjoyed Borat you will enjoy the tale of The Greatest Band on Earth,1

In 1993 with the success of the first season of Batman The Animated Series Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hitshow with producing a featurelength movie originally slated for DirectToVideo but bumped up to theatrical status It would become known as Batman Mask of the Phantasm Ten years after Phantasm we have had an additional three featurefilms released from the boys at the WB SubZero Return of the Joker and now Mystery of the Batwoman joins the familybr br The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin Now Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the linebr br The animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for Batman The Animated Series fifth and sixth seasons AKA The New Batman Adventures its quite nicely done and just as sleek as Return of the Jokers animation There is also some use of CGI but its minor compared to the overabundance of it in SubZero The music was alright Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans rodentshaped heartsbr br Kevin Conroy as always does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman Its also great to have the old Batman The Animated Series alumni back that includes Bob Hastings Commissioner Gordon Robert Costanzo Detective Bullock Tara Strong Barbara GordonBatgirl her cameo hints at the romanticrelationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond and Efrem Zimbalist JrAlfredbr br Villains were also great especially given that Rupert Thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth seasonbr br Overall while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan you will love the fiveminute short Chase Me,1
This movie took me by surprise The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation After that were plunged into a semicheesy production betraying its low budget The characters typical American teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this By the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities Its a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster Thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school HORROR Steve Johnsons makeup effects are awesome Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films And the scares are jolting Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever with heartstopping surprises and creepy suspenseful setups The tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like Night of the Living Dead or Hills Have Eyes But for true horror fans this one is worth checking out Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of House on the Haunted Hill The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking,1
An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon I remember this very well from my childhood it was funny and sad and very beautiful Well it starts out a bit dark a dog who escaped the pound and gets killed by an old friend ends up in Heaven and comes back But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons like the dream sequence of Charlie but everything else was okayand the songs were fair A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise I just love that guy ahehehe And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge may God rest her soul poor girl she didnt deserve to die but she is in Heaven now all good people go to Heaven Overall this is a very good animated movie a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame Recommended for the whole family And know this if you have the original video of this youll find after the movie Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message gotta love that guy ahehehe,1
It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance I had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing If you loved Bulgakovs book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an artfilm project than for actually bringing the storys deeper meaning to the screen There are a couple examples of this with the Master and Margarita As complex and farfetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakovs work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a scorewith not a note missed Why cant we find such talent here in the US So now my favorite book and movie have the same title,1
I havent read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on but who knows maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health It isnt that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that Ive read on one hand but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire I get the feeling that she writes really good novels The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire historybr br Still Stuart Townsends voiceover narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitts vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNEDs limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places The costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrackbr br However Ill give credit where credit is due The soundtrack is excellent Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Buttheadbr br The film opens with a very cool Gothrock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly Its as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasnt enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects Unfortunately QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress Where are the yellow contacts Wheres the pale blue makeup Scene after scene I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salems Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done rightbr br There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage Props to Aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace She might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing Did I mention that the soundtrack was good Lets see what else can I say It wasnt too long The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of secondrate vampire movies out there The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anythingbr br JYbr br Jimboduckdotcom,1
Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide What film was he looking at Kid Vengeance or Gods Gun are bombs This film is a delight It is fantastic It is literate It is well mounted It is beautiful photographed making a brilliant use of colors Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a welldone satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre The film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to Douglas Fairbanks 77 Sunset Strip and the famous showdown in the Good the Bad and the Ugly Edd Byrnes George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work It is too bad Mr Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved One can only guess as to his reason I suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire,1
If you wish to see Shakespeares masterpiece in its entirety I suggest you find this BBC version Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but Jacobys performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewarts as Claudius are well worth the effortbr br It never ceases to amaze me how clear Hamlet is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard Every film version of Hamlet has tinkered with its structure Olivier concentrated on Hamlets indecision Gibson on his passions Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlets character together with the aid of Shakespeares full scriptbr br Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately Hamlet says I am very proud revengeful ambitious Hamlet is extremely upset not only for his fathers death and suspected murder or his mothers marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius marriages between royal kin is not unknown done for political reasons but that her marriage solidified Claudius claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself He is therefore impotent to do anything about it And this is true even after he hears his fathers ghost cry vengeance He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so He must out the Kings secret and here is the tragedy At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius guilt in public he has opportunity to kill him and does not WHY He wants it ALL He wants revenge the throne AND the damnation of Claudius soul in hell Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form His own HUBRIS is his undoing He kills Polonius thinking it is Claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of Rosencrantz Guildenstern Ophelia Laertes Gertrude Claudius and Hamlet himself,1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian familys journey from the Old World Italy to the New World America Salvatore a middleaged man who hopes for a more fruitful life persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily take the arduous journey across the raging seas and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk In short they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled The imagery of the New World is optimistic clever and highly imaginative Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous hell be in the New World carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while theyre aboard the ship to the New Worldbr br The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive This is shown as Salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left donkeys goats and rabbits in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit The most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promisebr br As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island but is remained hidden I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for Give me your poor your tired your hungry seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World Once they arrived in the Americas they had to go through rather humiliating tests ie delousing mathematics puzzles etc in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people In particular Salvatores mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World feeling more violated than treated with respect Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude Salvatore doesnt change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be acceptedbr br The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society Cleanliness marriage and intelligence are prerequisites Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct Though the rules seemed rigid they were there to protect and help the people flourish,1
Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs but with clever dollop of suspense Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a brokendown bus on its way to nowhere but which passenger is it talk about your illegal immigrants Allstar supporting cast from wildeyed Jack Elam hamming it up shamelessly to sexy Jean Willes if shes the Martian then I say lets open the borders to cruelfaced John Hoyt the most obvious suspect along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver Makes for a very entertaining halfhour even if the action is confined to a single set,1

If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining Its got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting matchups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles As evident on this board the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling To get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction I know I know thats hard to do when you consider Custers Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and its prominence in the history of post Civil War America So I guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at itbr br Theres a lot to take in here though for the pictures two hour plus run time Custers arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia The practical joke by Sharp Arthur Kennedy putting him up in the Majors headquarters probably should have gotten them both in troublebr br Ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in Custers first meeting with Libby Bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie Hattie McDaniel I hadnt noticed it before in other films but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties Mantan Moreland So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress With that in mind the owl scene was a hoot toobr br As for Flynn its interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed JEB Stuart opposite Ronald Reagans depiction of General Custer in Santa Fe Trail both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland In that film Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers while in Flynns portrayal here its more than evident But it doesnt come close to that of Richard Mulligans take on the military hero in 1970s Little Big Man Lets just say that one was a bit over the topbr br The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on ones point of view Earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custers character when he stated You take glory with you when its your time to go,1
Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latterday peer in my opinion respectfully The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things For those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing Rank and BritishGaumont studios back in the day frankly I prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any overproduced Hollywood movie ever could This reminds me of Powell and Pressburgers The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman a favorite of mine John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be Mr Portmans film but the whole cast shines As for the title sequence am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Productions lovely preCGI Gainsborough Girl,1
A brilliant horror film Utterly gruesome and very scary too The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter but please do not let that put you off this film It is simply brilliant The start of the film has the aliens spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the films title in amazing shining white and blue stating THE THING One of the best opening credits for a horror film everbr br The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen It must have been great in the cinema I regret not seeing this on the big screenbr br Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection it is tense scary and finally spectacular I love it because its funny as wellbr br Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself If he didnt get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenters greatest filmits certainly a gruesome masterpiecebr br Wait for a cold winter night Get some Budweiser from the fridge Sit down and watch The Thing a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slimebr br Utterly brilliantbr br Ten Out Of Ten,1
I absolutely love this film Everything about it It almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen The way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece very original and creative I related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some Im really glad I ran across this movie If only there were more genius like justin out there,1
A new way to enjoy Goldsworthys work Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he uses Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the tides inspires and affects his work Although I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthys pieces no snowballs I do feel it was a bit long The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthys work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch,1
I just started watching The Show around July I found it by mistake I was channel surfing during a Vacation It is a great show I just wish it wasnt on so late at night Its on at 1230 AM As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the timebr br I read some comments I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60s and not believing that this stuff can happenbr br I grew up in the 60s Im Hispanic and I had a White boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School I believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or colorbr br I cant wait till the show goes on DVD so I can buy it This way I can see it from the beginning,1
This film is well cast often silly and always funny Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection Brent Spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director From the first hare krishna to the last you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy,1
Normally I dont like series at all Theyre all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fastbr br These series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mindbr br The episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital,1
This movie is without a doubt a perfect 1010 for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chans movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time Porn is watched for the porn Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION i think you people are rating it bad because theres no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained Sure the middle of the movie was boring VERY BORING but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that This did change the way how American action movies were created they have even stollen scenes from this movie If you want a true man a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chans hes pure in everyway He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park and even in TODAYS movies American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do a masterpiece,1
I saw this at the London Film Festival last night apparently the shorter version James McNallys summary of the content of the film is very good Nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversitybr br The film is shot on handheld DV which some might find offputting but which does enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipmentbr br Despite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the worlds dogs but also undercutting a number of interviewees comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves To a degree this evoked Michael Moores recent work although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls The Sorrow and the Pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of salt of the earth French peasants as the stars De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards We do indeed all need a little disorder bravo Hubertbr br Overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people and organise our world,1
This movie really woke me up like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumberbr br This guy John Ben Chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girltodiefor Nadia Nicole Kidman ordered by email from Russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by Johns plan However a glitch turns up Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language Although calm and emotionless on the outside John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service he buys her a dictionary to start the communication processbr br What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decentlypaid safefeeling clerk into a decisionmaking decently thinking action figure giving the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably acted likewisebr br Kidman Cassel Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural backgroundbr br The pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that youre in the middle of the plot and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes outbr br My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy To sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface Like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Societys machine the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings Welcome to the machine I bet that in the end John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at allbr br Thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie Please make a sequel And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 999999 percent of the potential viewers I am sure of it,1
I think this movie has got it all It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head It has cool looking characters IS REALLY funnyyou know the kind that youll crack up on the ground and youll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeksDespite the bad acting bad cgi and bad storyabout cops going after a robot its really cool Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more timesbr br There are so many funny parts like when Kurt was trying to get Edisons attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball On that part I kept saying Remember Rememberto my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was therejust before they fought and Kurt was talking about his Strange dream and how he was Superman I LOVED that part although it has been a while since I saw it so I dont remember that part Everything the actors said were funny like how Kurt says I worship you like a GOD to the robotbr br Although there was some bad things in all it was a GREAT movie Man I cant stop laughing I wish I had that movie,1
Howard Kevin Kline teaches English at the high school in a small Indiana city He is finally getting married to Emily Joan Cusack much to his parents delight The town is abuzz too because one of its own Cameron Matt Dillon has been nominated for an acting Oscar Everyone including Howard and Emily is watching the Academy Awards on television as Cameron is declared the winner In his acceptance speech Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man in part because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school You guessed it its Howard But Howard has never come out in fact he believes he is straight With the whole town and members of the media waiting and observing the happenings will Howard and Emily go ahead and get married Or is Howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony This is a wonderful funny and humane film about a gay man and his situation As the manwhodidnotrealizehewasgay Kline is excellent and touching The rest of the cast is equally fine with Cusack a stitch as the mixedup fiancé and Dillon Bob Newhart Debbie Reynolds Tom Selleck and others on hand to delight the audience as well The costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely Indiana heartland is beautiful Then too the script the direction and the production are very very nice But the insightful humorous and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the films best asset no doubt For those who would be offended by a gaythemed film yes just skip over this one But for everyone who wants to laugh heartily and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time this is definitely the best film out there,1
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age with the likes of The Four Feathers 1939 and Zulu simply because the Imperial age was for the most part British Here in The Wind and the Lion we see a wonderful rendering of Americas own Imperial agebr br Americas projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility is smitten by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn Politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of native peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage What makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy and vivid historybr br Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be Sean Connerys noble brigand Candace Bergens feisty heroine John Hustons wily John Hay or Steve Kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant Roosevelts Big Stick There is a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing Moor on his white steed This is high adventure at its best,1
One of Starewiczs longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange The dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters With the help of a stuffed cat the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewiczs films The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stopmotion animation makes for a new twist on Starewiczs old style of puppetry Live scenes of moving cars and peoples feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewiczs utilization of the new technology seems like old hat New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devils club scene Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene Overall Starewicz is able to update his style of filmmaking to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work,1
Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu Being a male Im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start It isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters Each has their own thing that they contend with Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have It didnt try to pound a lesson into us The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people,1

I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 only a few days ago I must admit that I am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life I also love the majority of Scandinavian cinematic offerings there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn Character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth This is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive I am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness,1
I think this is one hell of a movieWe can see Steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all Segal movies theres a message in it without the message it would be one of many actionfighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special,1
I saw this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it Then again that was when Claire Danes was a good actress not the foolish arrogant Hollywoodized bitch she is today Anyway this film really struck me as one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship films How far would you really go for your best friend I was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when I watch it now I own it I remember as soon as I left the theater I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if youd do something like that for her,1
Ive seen this film literally over 100 timesits absolutely jampacked with entertainment Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance As a fan of actors such as William Shatner Impulse 1974 and Ron Liebmann Up The Academy 1981I never thought an actor could capture the intensity like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones As far as Im concerned Powers Boothe IS Jim Jonesthis film captures his best performance,1

Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one She appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably Reesebr br I have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on I say that because whenever I have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in factbr br Anyway my first film experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland somehow I assumed that was her first time up at bat Not so well done Reese,1
This game ranks above all so far I had the honor of playing mine on PS2 so the graphics were really good The voice acting was above standard The difficulty level is just right Wesker has to be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion The story amazed me and took many different twist that I wasnt expecting The only rating this game deserves is great,1
This is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers Its certainly all been done before and since But The Violent Men is something specialbr br What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films Shes married to the crippled Edward G Robinson whos the cattle baron here but Robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent No matter to Barbara whose needs are being met by her brotherinlaw Brian Keith That doesnt sit well with either Dianne Foster who is Robinson and Stanwycks daughter nor with Lita Milan who is Keiths Mexican girl friendbr br The infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but Glenn Ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a Civil War veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here Hes every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often I almost expect those famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Fords mouth Im a peaceable man Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Menbr br The Fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadnt been explored before The following year Glenn Ford would do another western Jubal one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot componentbr br Theres enough traditional western stuff in The Violent Men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well,1

Yes ill say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underratedbr br Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mindbr br The acting was good apart from Thewlisbr br Stone really has a talent with this role Shes slick naughty and seductive and doesnt look a day older than she did in the firstShe really impressed melike in Casino Morrisey was also good He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it Thewlis however was lame He ruined his character and was overthetop the whole way He really suckedbr br Overall this movie not as good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch Just ignore Thewlis,1
I have seen this film at least 100 times and I am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus I still think Bryan Brown is the tops Brilliant Film,1
Meryl Streep is such a genius Well at least as an actress I know shes been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring Mrs Chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart But that just makes Streeps work all the more remarkable I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations About the film well there were a couple of interesting things I dont know much about Australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at miseryinducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues A pretty good film A bit different Grade B,1
Well heres another terrific example of awkward 70s filmmaking The rudimentary premise of Whats the matter with Helen is quite shocking and disturbing but its presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion In the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director Curtis Harrington Whoever Slew Auntie Roo and scriptwriter Henry Farrell Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but theres a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging 1930s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tapdancing The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique Were literally catapulted back to the 1930s with a sublime depiction of that eras music religion theatrical business and wardrobes Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to lifeimprisonment for murder Adelle Debbie Reynolds and Helen Shelley Winters flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia She only listens to the ramblings of a radioevangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies The script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced Theres never a dull moment in Whats the matter with Helen although the singing tapdancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters Shes downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady whos about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers combined There are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies house There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an Oscar are breathtaking,1
Black comedy isnt always an easy sell Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful like Fargo for example But usually they dont often find big audiences People seem to either set their minds for comedy or for serious mayhem There doesnt seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987br br DeVito plays an odd mammas boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with The mother is played by Anne Ramsey who passed away shortly after this was released and she is quite a caricature She is loud ugly rude and overbearing Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself he wants desperately to have his mother offed He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly doesnt have the guts to actually do it himself Thats where Billy Crystal comes in Crystal plays Larry Donner Owens creative writing teacher at a nearby community college Larry is a paranoid wouldbe intellectual novelist who claims his exwife stole his novel and made millions off it He is currently trying to write a new one but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence The night was Owen hears Larry wish his exwife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train Owen decides to travel to Hawaii and murder Larrys exwife Once it appears he has done so he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother The resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant Its certainly never dull and often full of surprisesbr br The acting is exceptional even if Ramsey was a bit over the top Crystal is as good as he can be and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the offbeat tone is truly refreshing I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy filmmaking Throw Momma From the Train takes chances Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered The film isnt too long and it is chock full of laughs Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone 9 of 10 starsbr br The Hound,1

Paul Verhoevens predecessor to his breakout hit Basic Instinct is a stylish and shocking neonoir thriller Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve played by Jeroen Krabbé a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes While there he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag Renée Soutendijk who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills himbr br Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things I like best about him This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesnt happen very often I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to workbut youll see what I mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one Ive mentioned but are lovely nonetheless a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in halflovelybr br The acting in The Fourth Man isnt anything to write home about but its solid throughout Jeroen Krabbé holds the audiences attention and looks the part as the drunken writer It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct but the original fatale did it best Paul Verhoevens direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and its a shame that he doesnt put it to better use Of all the Verhoeven films Ive seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me its worth the effort,1
Finally An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs This is a nondocumentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass Its all about football and its funny its really funny The director says The places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness The nonactors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind Excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness It has won the Jury Grand Prize Berlin 2006 Dear reader its nearperfect WHERE where can I get hold of it,1

The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world When war finally does arrive its ravages continue not for another five years but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the wandering sickness a pestilence that continues for another four yearsbr br Things to Come balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization The Wings Over the World concept plays out a bit corny though its spokesman Cabal Raymond Massey is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause If he fails others will follow This message is continually reinforced throughout the film brought home convincingly in Masseys end of movie speech Mans insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an all the universe or nothing mindsetbr br The films imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film Metropolis As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 the spectacle of the citys rebirth strikes a resonant chord as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movies eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is mans first mission to the moon but in 1936 a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969br br Things to Come is one of those rarities in film a picture that makes you think Which side will you come down on the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo Its not a comfortable question as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control,1
Fulci Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made Answer yes Cat in the Brain also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulcis last masterpiece Yes it is no matter what some people will say about it There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulcis moviesbr br Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself who plays well horrorsplattergore director who thinks he is slowly going insane Its filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here Being Fulci flick you need to know its gory How much Well pretty much I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore and believe me its a hard to archive Even the Braindead didnt stop it CITB is all about gore Almost every scene revolves about Fulci who after being hypnotized by khmmm evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from its wounds Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2 this IS the goriest Fulci movie Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie He is such a brilliant director Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where Fulci says making gore movies is kind of a sickness Ending is very good considering that Fulci and most of the Italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes If you are fun of the Fulci make sure you check it out If you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat Its only a movie ps some of the gore scenes within this movie Chainsaw dismemberment full tongue torn out eyeballs torn out maggot infested corpses zombies decapitations face being putted in boiling water stabs in the shower to head throat slit many parts of the body and organs being toast aside hammer smashed face,1

Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from PouSoi Cheang isnt really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison However it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action is your thingbr br Edison Chen plays Pang a Cambodian hitman who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge Sam Lee is Wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost With Wai closing in on his target Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abusebr br A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from Chen and Lee as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pangs love interest Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hardhitting Asian hyperviolence think along the lines of Chanwook Parks Vengeance trilogy Stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheangbr br Of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths Unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments Dog Bite Dog crosses it in a laughably overdramatic final scene Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on Eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on a now dead Yue delivering their baby moments before he himself diesbr br Whilst this film might not be a classic slice of Hong Kong excess with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals its still worth seeking out,1

I have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say Even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day It got me thinking What a false world this isbr br What do you do when your most loved ones deceive you Its said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance Same way some people are such that they are never grateful This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself br br A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster The surviving brother decides to take revenge Through this process we learn about the futility of this world Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyonebr br Amitabh gave the performance of his life The new actor Aryan gave a good performance The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show Her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance Chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herselfbr br A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi His movies always give some message to the audience His movies are like novels of Nanak Singh a Punjabi novelist whos novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience They are entertaining as well as lessongiving,1

There have been many documentaries that I have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI and at the very worst an act of murder Like most people when the siege at Waco was occurring I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult After seeing this I think that Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the US government through his eccentric actions Sure there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound But none of it was illegal It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless And it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the Waco site the clueless testimony of Janet Reno and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats Standing out most in my mind was NY representative and current US senator from NY Charles Schumer I voted for the man when I lived in NY state Im a Democrat pretty leftleaning too After seeing his actions on this committee I wish I could go back in time and vote for DAmato instead For anyone remotely interested in the government this is a very crucial film a must see I even think this should be shown in classes its that important,1
I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent It has its moments I guess you would say Some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic I wont be putting this movie in my DVD collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting I guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre The action is good the acting is decent the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story is pretty interesting 7 out of ten,1
Yes I call this a perfect movie Not one boring second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works Its one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reachbr br Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning There was nothing this actress couldnt do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side No hysterical outbursts with this lady I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interestingbr br The title fits this movie very well It is about desires human desires I think everyone can understand Actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on impulse everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go herebr br I liked what this movie has to say about youth about maturing and about the necessity to compromise The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcocks Shadow of a Doubt it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Langs considerably harsher movie Clash by Night made one year earlier where Stanywck stars in a similar part I can also recommend it,1
I would like to know if anyone know how I can get a copy of the movie Thats the way of the World Its been about 30 years since Ive seen this movie and I would like to see it again Earth Wind Fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes It was unfortunate that this group didnt take off like their counterparts in the early 70s but as previously stated racial tension existed in the United States which prohibited equalized exposure for the African American musical groups It is good to see that Earth Wind Fire continuing their success I would like to add this movie to my collection Someone please help me if possible Thank you for your attention Milton Shaw,1
I saw the movie Hoot and then I immediately decided to comment it The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet Some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably is like but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful This movie is not just about kids this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do When I was twelve I saw some waterlilies and I knew they are protected by law and didnt even dare to touch them not fearing of the law but fearing that I might harm them actually I am currently 15 What so ever the acting was great the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and Enjoy,1

When I first saw this film around 6 months ago I considered it interesting but little more But it stuck with me That interest grew and grew and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself I purchased the Criterion DVD box set and it turns out that I was right the second time Alexander Nevsky is a great film It is rousing and Im sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the Germansbr br That is the most common criticism against this film and against Eisenstein that it is merely propagandist and nothing else Its untrue He is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived By now the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisensteins films as art,1
Focus is another great movie starring William H Macy I first discovered Macy in Fargo and Ive seen a few of his films and he hasnt yet deceived me Macy is the archetypal nice guy with something to hide In Focus he plays the role of Lawrence Newman a loyal and hardworking stiff who harbours his handicapped mother at home The scene is set after World War II at the height of McCarthyism Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically antiSemite After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent he is asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve his failing eyesightbr br Unbelievably the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of Gertrude Hart his wife played by a great Laura Dern As the film unravels Newman will begin to see a whole different world where being Jewish is akin to being an animalbr br The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal The chilling thought is that in some places it probably still is,1
In Brave New Girl Holly comes from a small town in Texas sings The Yellow Rose of Texas at a local competition and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty I loved this movie It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace The acting was of course wonderful Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end It seems a sequel could be in the making Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production Quite a gem in the film archives,1

Going into see Seven Pounds i wasnt clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot have no idea what is going on and you think Tim who claims to be Ben is just a big asshole All of this comes to an end when the twistso to speak is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie Basically Tim will smith was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives By this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life tobr br The acting of this film is great as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress Rosario Dawson to me this is one of her better movies aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to She has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film Other actors such as woody Harrelson have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character Although the casting of the film was still goodbr br This movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped The movie however was still pretty good Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story Final thought seven poundsseven Stars,1
I saw Brothers Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn He shows up there because his brother has died and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brothers wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives Also the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait,1

This is definitely a must see film The excellent Director Alain Chabat also acting as Ceasar has managed to capture the very essence of the Adventures of Astérix the French comic books its based upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films This movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter The only drawback is that a nonFrench audience or at least a nonFrench speaking audience might not get all the private jokes There are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the French way of life that the fun might be lessened However its still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting All actors are great but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer And please dont EVER compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books Astérix et Obélix Contre César and directed by Claude Zidi,1

I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling Gentleman Jim the best boxing movie ever made That is the Robert WisePaul Newman flick Somebody Up There Likes Me That movie might be number 1 but Gentleman Jim is a close number 2br br The movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of James J Corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bareknuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved Marquis of Queensbury rules And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectabilitybr br Gentleman Jim is not a realistic look at those days It is romanticized and yes even a bit hokey at times But always delightfully so Errol Flynn is perfect as the Gentleman Jim who really isnt a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a lovehate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the endbr br At the end of Gentleman Jim the great John L Sullivan whose famous line was NOT I can lick any man in the world of courseromanticism again hands over his belt to Corbett This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made Realistic No But wonderful Hey if you want realism watch Raging Bull instead That is a much more realistic boxing movie But Gentleman Jim is a lot more fun,1
Some people drift through life moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye others latch on to a cause another person or a principle and remain adamant committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it But were all different Made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting Some people are just plain crazy though and maybe thats the way you have to be to live among the masses Who knows Who knows what it takes to make things life work Writerdirector Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession in Committed starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too Her name is Joline and this is her storybr br Admittedly Joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general Shes a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what And when she marries Carl Luke Wilson its forever The only problem is someone forgot to tell Carl and 597 days into the marriage hes gone off to find himself and figure it all out When Joline realizes hes not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage Maybe its because of that clay shes made of Regardless she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him which she does in El Paso Texas of all places But once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space and not even letting him know shes there She considers Carl as being in a spiritual coma and its her job to keep a spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses And while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named Carmen Patricia Velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries Carmens Grampy Alfonso Arau who is something of a mystic TBo Mark Ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl and Neil Goran Visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her For Joline its a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about Carl but even more about herselfbr br Theres a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot And Krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining Her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story We see it from Jolines pointofview as Krueger makes us privy to Jolines thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold That along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling Theres an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavyhanded or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters And the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call lifebr br Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real And for this film to work it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable and Graham succeeds on all fronts Her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely its all a part of the character she creates theres an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out Shes a likable agreeable person and because youve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is Its a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to lifebr br As Carmen Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging as well Her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character She has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively downtoearth She is refreshingly open and upfront you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal And as with Joline this character is well written and Velazquez brings her convincingly to lifebr br Overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of Luke Wilson Casey Affleck as Jolines brother Jay Goran Visnjic Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as TBo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable characterbr br The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens Jenny Clea Du Vall Mimi Summer Phoenix Meg Art Alexakis New York Car Thief Dylan Baker Carls Editor and Mary Kay Place Psychiatrist A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture reflecting upon who we are where were going and what we really need Committed is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking 810,1
i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasnt sure that i was getting Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies ie sister actbr br however this was not really comedy it is a drama with comedic moments so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep lookingbr br this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community i do think that it is worth a chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isnt for you,1
Having been a Marine I can tell you that the DI is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting Marine Corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men Jack Webb is excellent as SgtJim Moore a tough but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina The film centers on one recruit who doesnt seem to get with the program A more recent film Full Metal Jacket also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing,1
Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should bebr br The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about whats going on and you really want to view it for the second time But after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can bebr br A word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie This is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big bbs and lots of bloodbr br If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 51ch without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation And dont forget to switch the light offbr br My points on different aspectsbr br Direction 910 Acting 810 Atmosphere 1010 Sound Effect 910br br Total 910,1
Quitting may be as much about exiting a preordained identity as about drug withdrawal As a rural guy coming to Beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success Troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity The ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grimbr br But what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director Zhang Yang and his actors bring to this journey No clichés no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims br br Hongshen Jia is in his midtwenties Hes a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved The perfect recipe for his enablers Soon hes the cool actor idolized by youth He was hot in the early nineties He always had to be the most fashionable He needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf His acting means the arts friendsand roles But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input And his selfcriticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational selfdoubt selfhatred I didnt know how to act I felt like a phonyand to readily available drugs to counter them He says I had to get high to do what director wanted So his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity br br Hongshens disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittentand doggedly his own Solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy The abstract is out And a great deal of his change occurs outdoorsnot in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and highrises of Beijing The physicality is almost romantic but is not The bike rides to Ritan Park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain grassy picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific He drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity I started to open up he says of this period in retrospect And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancers positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in a current circumstance If mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night br br Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and TV and bangs his head till bloody against his John Lennon Forever poster He has let down his iconic antiestablishment artistbut hes the only viable guide he knows He even imagines himself as Johns son Yoko Ono and adopts his Mother Mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the parkhallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals Music is so much more real than acting he says And speaks of Lennons influence as showing me a new way In the mental institute the lifesaving apples resistance nourishment reflect Lennons presence as does Hongshens need to rehang his heros poster in his redecorated roombr br If Lennons influence is spiriting Hongshens fathers influence is grounding Although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is Fegsens differences from his son that underwrites his change For the father is more secure in himself he accepts that hes Chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions Its this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans Beatles and passivity In his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts I acted before were bullshit life is bullshit And to Hongshens emphatic you are NOT my father he softly replies why cant a peasant be your father br br Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to a real not whole self As the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity Indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust Integrity banishes his black cloud All his edges soften You are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strapdown incurred for refusing medicine Back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now And his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant backtoback fence scene with his musician buddy Hongshen says of this movie its a good chance to think about my life And I might add become a New Actor one bound to art and life Like Lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity,1
I have watched this movie countless times and never failed to be charmed by its homely simplicity sincerity and goodness Great characterizations by all of the cast and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting roleI confess I fell in love with Roberta in 1970 and she still touches me today Shown on TV in New Zealand on Christmas day the nicest present I could have had,1
Even though I saw this film when I was very young I already knew the story of Wild the ThiefTaker and Shepherd who famously escaped from Newgate prisonbr br Apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less faithfully follows the true story The temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many socalled historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for thatbr br Of the performances There is scarcely a poor performance and Tommy Steele is ideally cast Also good is Stanley Baker as the ThiefTaker and Alan Badel is good as alwaysbr br Because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family,1
Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of workparticularly in the 1940s1950sranging from dramas to quirky comedies I particularly love his comedies as they are so welldone and seem so natural and real on the screenfar different from the usual fare from Hollywoodbr br This being said this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies Its plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhereexcept for Ealing Studioswhich had a particular fondness for little films like this onebr br Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company He wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work So he tends to sneak into labs either during the day if no one suspects or at night and try his hand at inventing Repeatedly he is caught such as after he blew up the lab and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds Then despite the importance of the discovery he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of eventsand then the fun beginsbr br The film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry unions the government and people in general,1
Victor McLaglens performance is one of the finest in film historybr br I think we can all feel for Gypo because weve all struggled with what is right and what isnt and been wrong This was one of the first arthouse pictures to be released by a major American movie studio RKO Radio Picturesbr br Joseph H Augusts cinematography is at its very best here However Augusts stunning portion was mostly overlooked he didnt receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deservedbr br This is a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all conveyed with as little words as possible,1
The sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn Its peak years were between 1968 and 1972 One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers She was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystiquebr br Gary Graver the director was also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with Monica Gayles screen presence makes Sandra the Making of a Woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience The film never drags and you wont have your finger pressed on the fastforward button,1
What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be This is the type of film that Ive been looking for ages Particularly important for me was the fantasticlooking Chicago which I still keep thinking about The back cover doesnt do this film justice its superb and in my top5 for sure,1
I cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie I thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen It my have been bc i am Mel Brooks biggest fan I know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them when it is played on a Family Channel this is one of my favorite movies so i dont know why any one would disagree thanks Kristina,1
Flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully Playing reallife boxing champ Jim Corbett Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bareknuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge The next day he gets a chance via Smith to gain entrance to the judges private club He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the clubs resident boxer His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion John L Sullivan Bond Flynn is downright magical here He is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role He looks terrific especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn At this stage he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell Bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynns manager The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynns rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed A few of the sets are amazingly presented Some of Smiths gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well Its a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but its also so much more Some of it like the character traits shown by Flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but a lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes One line is particularly memorable I believe you like me more than I like you but its entirely possible that I love you more than you love me Its classic romantic dialogue and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well,1
Often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than its seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett Plot centers on two chauffers whove bet on which one of them can bed his employer both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy Bisset and Woronov first If Manuel wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend br br Lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc But a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface Bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy teenaged niece on a year long missionary trip to Africabr br Hilarious fun,1
Thought provoking humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war A small but altruistic view of one familys interactions with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky This movie lessens the glamor of war showing its effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unitbr br A lot of todays movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the heros and other glamorous features of war but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community This movie attempts this through a retelling of a persons memory of those days This movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events when in reality this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds perhaps thousands of actual events during the civil war I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie,1
elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a Outrageous story if you have not seen it you are missing out on one of the greatest films made i cant wait till her new movie comes out,1
I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful especially since it was based on a true man Pierce Brosnan was very good as the loner English man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl The photography was beautifulbr br This movie made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simple as Grey Owl I want to read as much as I can about him At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it But I am not surprised I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing I gave it the highest rating However I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their housebr br You cant go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes,1
Bend it like Beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line It is about a girl called Jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve The song choices are really good hush my child just move on upto your destination and you make boundaries and complications Anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review Bend it like Beckham great flick,1
Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Premingers Where the Sidewalks Ends from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel Night Cry by Frank Rosenbergbr br Dana Andrews is the honest tough New York policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strongarm methods as much as he detests crooks When he hit someone his knuckles hurt And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain Gary Merrill who points up the title Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter he asks Andrews I have as much right on the sidewalk as youbr br Dana Andrews obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of a thief His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendettabr br By a twist of irony unique to the film itself Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of Laura are united once more and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks This time he goes too far and accidentally kills a suspect The killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jailbr br Using his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate a gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way a compromisebr br The film is one of the best detective films of the 50s with curious moral values also one of Premingers best br br Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism,1
Riding high on the success of Rebel Without a Cause came a tidal wave of teen movies Arguably this is one of the best A very young McArthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen The story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence The supporting cast is memorable Frankenheimer directs like an old pro Just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously,1
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isnt a perfect movie but Im pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings Campbell is as a writer uneventhere are lots of things in the story that dont make a great deal of sense why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other better incarnations the scene in the restaurant where Yegor and William battle for control of Williams body is straight out of Evil Dead II There are however lots of little touches and nonsequiturs that feel rather brilliant such as when William is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue What are you looking at The movie looks like a SciFi Channel original probably because it was The acting is actually pretty good I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya she was ruthless and cunning yes but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored Ted Raimi handled the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and Bruce is funny as the arrogant sardonic condescending American jerk Now that hes writing his own films youd think hed give himself a role that he hasnt been typecast in already Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre nonsensical Bmovie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously,1
This film held my interest enough to watch it several times The plot has holes but the lead performers make it workbr br Catherine Mary Stewart Julia Kerbridge does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dreambr br Meanwhile Julias sister and brotherinlaw are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda Arlen AguayoStewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance Amanda is so traumatized from her parents murder that she has become mute Needless to say Julias 16hour days get longer caring for Amandabr br Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Juliabr br The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other You can see them working out a relationship as the film progressesbr br We discover that Julias sister and brotherinlaw the Meyers were involved in industrial espionage They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossedbr br In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them The killers search the home and fail to find their prize They leave a living witness to their crime Amanda The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located Eventually the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchips locationbr br Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future togetherbr br What struck me about the plot were major holes Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mentionbr br The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming Filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort,1
Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a wholebr br Without giving away too much of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves br br The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the US br br The film is lighthearted youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe All of the films characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfectionsbr br Ive been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance Is this synchronous or what I think so because now Im really geeked to give it a try br br Watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and againbr br Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery as it is perfect asis,1
The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheardof population is compelling welldocumented and enraging As an American I am constantly humiliated by my countrys behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement We suck This is probably the first John Pilger documentary Ive seen but it immediately made me want to see what else hes done My only complaint and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10 is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments demands that we viewerscitizens are complicit in our own inactionbut makes no suggestion of how to help I dont know about Britain but Americas made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their governments doings A gesture in the right direction might help these islanders cause,1
This is a very memorable spaghetti western It has a great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from Rosalba Neri Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic She steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when shes not speaking Her performance is very believable She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that theres anything wrong with being over the top Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie toobr br The music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not There are a couple of parts that are very amusing I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot Theres also lots of slick gunplay thats very well donebr br I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasnt for two things The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie It is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence HillBud Spencer comedy but this is a more serious western and the brawl really needed to be more realistic The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yumas cowardly Mexican sidekick I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasnt at all funny All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him br br All that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie,1
The plot Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his 1st big chance He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy And oh yes theres romance and a little sadness too The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008 It must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st not just a tribute to silent films Later years would bring similar films such as Singin in the Rain1952 Dick Van DykeCarl Reiners The Comic1969 What is special about this film though is recreating silent movies in 1939 We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone eraalthough some sound effects are includedin glorious bw while the rest of the movie is in pristine color One of the greatest in the silent era Buster Keaton who at this point was on an uphill climb is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well But the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennetts film legacy It doesnt take a genius to realize this movie is a positive reworking of Mack Sennetts and Mabel Normands life The character Michael Linnett Connors is Mack Sennett whose real name was Michael Sinnott And Molly of course is Mabel Sennett had the pie throwings the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops He worked with Buster Keaton Ben Turpincameo Roscoe Fatty Arbucklebody double and fell in love with his leading lady Not only all that but Sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well As most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture As Mack Sennett fell into that category it is fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade Sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies His career started in 1908 as an actor then writer director producer He semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit He had worked with the best such as Charlie Chaplin Gloria Swanson Bing Crosby WC Fields Keaton Harry Langdon Arbuckle and even Roy Rogersin Way Up TharAs film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career Mack played it wise did only selective work for the next 25 years In 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work In the 1940s his presence was still felt eg Here Come the CoEds1945where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Macks Wandering Willies1926is done In 1947 The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennetts Crosby films 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated With his knack of always associating with the right people a guest role with the eternally popular Lawrence Welk his radio show came about later in the year 1950 brought a rerelease of his greatest triumph Tillies Punctured Romance1914 with sound In 1952 he was honored on TVs This Is Your Life then his autobiography The King of Comedy1954 which is a great companion piece to Hollywood Cavalcade was published 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott Costello as he had a cameo in AC Meet the Keystone Kops Finally in 1957 another tribute with the compilation film The Golden Age of Comedy So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer In the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table As we get to the silver haired Mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here I am When he rises to give a speech a short while later he is at his most subdued underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey I know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget Mack Sennett the individual Maybe this movie will help,1
It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage And any woman who got involved with Adam Hoss and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV westernbr br Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights People have relationships some go good some not so good its just life And were less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivors nobility intact But thats if Bonanza were done todaybr br But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped the secret of Bonanzas success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children The kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinchbr br The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that br br Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show Rumor has it he didnt care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious Perhaps if it were done now hed have liked it better in the way I describebr br This was just the beginning for Michael Landon how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control Little Joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the Cartwrights br br When Roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big Dan Blocker left the heart went out of Bonanza Other characters had been added on by that time David Canary Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel But big loyal but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that familybr br So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City It doesnt look anything like what you see in Bonanza But near Lake Tahoe just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the Cartwright home the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are realbr br And if they werent real they should have been,1
One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers an observation which mystifies me Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Leeit had many young actors who were to become major stars eg Tobey Maguire before Spiderman Skeet Ulrich before Jericho Jonathan Rhys Meyers before Tudors James Caviezel Simon Baker Mark Ruffalo Jeffrey Wright Tom Wilkinson and Jewel All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killingbr br When the biographies and accomplishments of the director even when he won an academy award and the actors are listed this film is usually omitted from their past performances I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films However it is seldom every seen on cable I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known,1
Its nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like itbr br I think the story was a little rushed at the end but extending that would have made the story even longer Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant and possibly tied with my tutor friendbr br It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema not as great as My sassy girl but still good,1
Of all the movies of the seventies none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the Sentinel I mean yes there were movies like the Exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one If you have time check this one out You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is a story worth getting intoThen there are all the stars and soontobe stars My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith Then there are the subtle clues that lead to whats going on too Pay close attention I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like black and white cat black and white cake Plus the books are really good as well Im just sorry that theyre not going to turn the second book into a film Its so scary that it would outdo this movie,1
This is apparently the second remake of this film having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 And in so many ways it reminds me of the later film A YANK AT OXFORD Both films concern a conceited blowhard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blowhard slowly learning about teamwork and decency In this film William Haines is Tom Brown and his main rival Bob is played by Frances X Bushman And in a supporting role is Jack Pickfordalways remembered as the brother of Mary Of these three Pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes Toms palhe actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game All the standard clichés are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises However it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewingbr br In my opinion for a better silent college film try Harold Lloyds THE FRESHMANits football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET among othersand if youve seen one of these films youve seen them all Well made but certainly NOT original And because it is just a rehash of his other films anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other filmsbr br 42508I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920 Talk about overrated There are dozens and dozens of better filmshow this film got to be 1 is anyones guess,1
Owen loves his Mammaonly hed love her better six feet under in this dark laughoutloud comedy that both stars and is directed by Danny DeVito with admirable assists from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title rolebr br Throw Momma From The Train is a terrific comedy even if it isnt a great film Its too shallow in parts and the ending feels less organic than tacked on But its a gutsplitting ride most of the way with Crystal and DeVito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer DeVito is avid but untalented Crystal is blocked and bitterbr br Crystals Professor Donner believes his exwife stole his book the unfortunately titled Hot Fire and cant write more than the opening line of his next book which doesnt come easy He teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities including a middleaged woman who writes Tom Clancytype fiction but doesnt know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life Mr Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughsperminutesonscreen an ascotwearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus 100 Girls Id Like To Porkbr br Then theres DeVitos Owen Lift who calls himself Professor Donners star pupil even though the teacher wont read his work in class Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie a manchild in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother Anne Ramsey who calls him lardass and other endearing sentiments In any other movie wed be asked to feel sorry for Owen but Throw Momma From The Train piles lifes cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along Thats one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of peoplebr br For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even identifying with him and take the rest of what we see here as a lark its not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while Owen enlists Professor Donners help in a plan to kill his mother Actually he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donners hated ex then tells the professor its his turn to kill Mrs Lift swapping murders as seen in Hitchcocks Strangers On A Trainbr br As a director DeVito not only complements his actors performances with scenesetting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes and away from taking things too seriouslybr br Also helping matters is writer Stu Silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here Shes not a womanShes the Terminator One little murder and Im Jack the Ripper Those are all Crystals words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are DeVitos and Ramseys Apparently Silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the IMDb and thats a shame because he had real talent for itbr br The best scene in this movie when Crystal meets Ramsey was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical coming attraction presentation the only time Ive seen a movie promoted that way Owen introduces the professor to his mother as Cousin Patty and when Momma says he doesnt have a Cousin Patty panicky Owen loses it You lied to me he yells out slamming the professors forehead with a panbr br Of course in reality the professor wouldnt groan out something witty from the floor but Throw Momma From The Train works effectively at such moments when playing its Looney Tunes vibe for all its worth DeVito hasnt disappeared from films of course but its a mystery why he hasnt really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie Maybe its because as Throw Momma From The Trains lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isnt to everyones tastes Thats too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it,1

Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally worthwhile It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s Which is why Id have loved to see followup movies but judging by the rest of Full Moons output there simply werent enough tits to satisfy the typical audience Unfortunately thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience which is unfortunate because without em this could have been a Harry Potterstyle magicfest that kids would have eaten up Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great I wasnt sure if Ms Nipar hadnt wandered off an Alist picture onto this film she was very believable No seriously Anyway its a shame they didnt have the bucks to license Dr Strange because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom,1
It doesnt happen very often but occasionally one man can make a difference a big differencebr br George Criles 2003 best seller CHARLIE WILSONS WAR is a fascinating and eyeopening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas Good Time Charlie was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation Likable and licentious even for a politician Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone Its Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known appropriately enough as Charlies Angelsbr br When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young aides his response is a classic You can teach em to type but you cant teach em to grow tits No argument therebr br But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter humiliating defeat of the Russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result Fat chance huhbr br Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin CHARLIE WILSONS WAR is a sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicles the behindthe scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising Charlies Teambr br The onscreen Team is composed of three marvelous actors with four 4 Academy Awards and nine 9 nominations between them Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years Hes aided abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring a wealthy Houston socialite played by the stillslinky Julia Roberts Hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this By all accounts Ms Roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know but we as an audience never do As for the third member of the Team Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos a smart street wise ie non Ivy League graduate CIA malcontent who knows the score both in the Agencys boardroom and in Wilsons bedroombr br For the Mujahideen to succeed the most important assistance the US can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies This takes money lots of money and eventually Charlies Team covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of 1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels This includes topoftheline stateoftheart antiaircraft and antitank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices Nasty nasty stuffbr br That this kind of multibillion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the businessasusual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government Oh momma I wish it werent sobr br Even though the initial outcome for Team Charlie was an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others Since the funding was entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention Yes once the Russkies left so did our aid zip for schools zip for infrastructure zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people As a result the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster its like the forerunner to Mission Accomplishedbr br As Nichols film so pointedly points out The ball youve set in motion can keep bouncing even after youve lost interest in it Mike Krzyzewski knows this Eva Longoria Parker knows this little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this but the typical American politician doesnt So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldnt let the world know we were the good guys Talk about a Catch22 another Mike Nichols filmbr br Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best We fked up the end gamebr br Again,1

Chuck Joness Rabbit Seasoning the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons I would have to concede that Rabbit Seasoning is the most finely honed script Here the emphasis is placed on language as Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costellos Whos on next routine As a long term Daffy fan I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines the famous Pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics and does most of the work Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer as always is the befuddled dupe Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration Youre despicable As intricate an example of Chuck Joness impeccable timing as youll come across Rabbit Seasoning is a true classic,1
A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear Also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a B picture it has to fit into a slot,1
Crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir thats a murder mystery with a strong message It stars Robert Young Robert Mitchum Robert Ryan Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film Young as the detective Finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why The victim Joseph Samuels Sam Levene is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and Samuels winds up deadbr br I dont know about 1947 but seeing Crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects I dont suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started Nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing antiSemite languagebr br The characterizations are vivid including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role shes a woman who meets Mitchell George Cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan but everyone is excellent Robert Young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective Mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wifebr br Truly excellent and a must see,1

Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy He was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing So Rodolfo Sonego did If you check out his biography you can see the number of movies that have been made in Italy Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories My uncle visited Australia and my town in 1968 to check out locations for A girl in Australia and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war You can see his humor in all his movies I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently GREAT,1

What can you say about the film White Fire Amazing Fantastic Disturbing Hilarious These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire From wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughoutbr br Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms When the father separates from the mother and their childen you get a real sense of what kind of movie youre about to watch Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets peoples attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised unsafe stunt Meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre HALT and then promptly wastes the mother This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingredbr br So now we fast forward about 20 years 30 if youre honest about the heros age to beautiful Turkey where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while Bo masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship They dont seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its a shame youre my sister he says to her while shes stark naked make for a very dynamic duo Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new lovebr br So anyway theres a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plotlines Fred the hammer Williamson for some reason and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes All of these things are great but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie specialreally special So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire You may be glad you didor not,1

Youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia going through most of Europe Italy Bulgaria Croatia Slovenia Turkey before arriving in the Middle East But this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sightsbr br Redas father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the Haj However since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to Mecca by car He cant drive and therefore enlists the help of Reda to his sons protest to get him there in their broken down vehiclebr br But Reda doesnt see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand And hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of palsbr br The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water Through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differencesbr br Its perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destinationbr br It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are Dont miss this and yes book early I was pleasantly surprised that this evenings session was still a full house,1

I like Ghost stories Good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained Now Ive see many of them As special efx have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories Now this one very rare pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story called The New House was one of the most scariest films I ever saw It was on once in 1972I was only 9but nothing since then even compared to it With all the remake going on in Hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special efx than the original This episode was down right creepy as hell Im lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close was the ORIGINAL The Haunting and George C Scott in The Changling Wish someone would do more ghost stories like these,1
This film is so old I never realized how young looking Ray Milland looked in 1936 I remember him playing in a great film Lost Weekend Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart who is a very rich banker There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy They hire a man to pose as a very rich Count his name is Count Ariszted Misha Auer who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture Deanna Durbin Penny Craig surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then Penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I have every heard the entire police department and convicts started applauding which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film This is Deanna Durbins first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM,1
If you like SciFi Monsters and Ancient Legends then you will love this movie br br The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago While the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for itbr br I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TVbr br If you like nonstop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and loreyou have to see this movie,1
A rather silly little film you just may lovebr br Although rather corny and cliché at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun Five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best teambr br Notable for several screen debuts including David Naughtons first film role after his Dr Pepper Be a Pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit American Werewolf in London Also features Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Hermanesquire roll a year before he became known for it And last but not least Mr Spin City and Alex Keaton himself Michael J Fox gets his first film role here Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House Outside of that no names but all funny charactersbr br Doubt it has ever made it to DVD but there are still probably some VHS copies floating around and you might even catch on a late late show sometime If you do is worth your watch You may hate it but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love,1
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown I cant say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy Given the excellent story the result could have been better though The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing Sound effects and sound tracks were very good Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak For people who didnt read the book things may look happening too quickly From my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican You see neither of it in the movie Too much rush and using the time not in a good way these are main problems of the movie So it is worth watching but could have been done better,1
What can I say Not as bad as many here have made it out to be The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANEbr br I was not disappointed in the least IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role Hes always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actorbr br As for the rest of the film Every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances These people certainly werent being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was a fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to thembr br I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAULs performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this moviebr br The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film Anybody who expected a clearcut bythenumbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie CLEARLY wasnt watching the film closely enough This film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is The idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee I certainly didbr br No car chases No explosions No bar room brawls sounds pretty dull huh But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and its just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involvedbr br WARNING If youre the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directlybr br YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM,1
In 1929 director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their Silly Symphonies series The Skeleton Dance Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in Disneys LaughOGram cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio That was the birth of Celebrity Productions where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of Flip the Frog While his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed Later that year Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in colorbr br 1937s Skeleton Frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic The Skeleton Dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune Like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play The dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune Now its not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra its hard to dance with loose body parts Everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their gravesbr br Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself Skeleton Frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by The Skeleton Dance years before although with a crucial difference Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before It is certainly a more experimental film than The Skeleton Dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily a better film For starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects It looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after allbr br However it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W Stalling for The Skeleton Dance In other words while DeNats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while Stallings song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable Being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerks flawless work of animation Personally I think that with a better musical accompaniment Skeleton Frolics would be remembered as fondly as The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking as its still a fun film to watchbr br Its kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer Disneys main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney Despite its shortcomings Skeleton Frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just cant help but thinking of The Skeleton Dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that Iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire usbr br 810,1

This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other It should have managed a wider distribution as its much better than similar films from major studios out at the same timebr br The swimming instructor is an almostOlympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students He attempts more or less to fend them off with varying resultsbr br The students characters are mainstream USA teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom havent learned to swim for some reason The movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class Several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guysbr br This is a good date movie or just one to watch when youre in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality,1

I watched Six of a Kind for WC Fields hes only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments The reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the bumbling banker J Pinkham Whinney He is everyones foil He stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure Also his comedy partner Mary Boland plays his wife Flora Joining in the proceedings are George Burns and Gracie Allen Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but Gracie and Ruggles use up most of the picture Gracies funny quite but she can also get tiring And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time I dont remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with Ruggles where Ruggles tries desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with Fields where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater that bit is exclusively Fields though The situation is constantly funny the Whinneys are going to drive to California but to help them with expenses George and Gracie are recruited 810,1

Although I was hoping that Id like it a little more this was still certainly an impressive film There were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what Id call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested For me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well I also thought that the low budget suited this movie for I dont think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim All things considered it fell a little short of my expectations but Im still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie,1

I was drawn to Friends by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called Seasons then I found the Elton John song Friends thinking it was the same songits been 35 years of so Anyway the flood of the emotions of Friends came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love I have more recall of the way the movie hit me than I do of the actual details of the production plot etc so forgive me for a rather poor review I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and tearyeyed at the end as I was Im both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now So many movies which seemed so important to me back then ie The Graduate Easy Rider now just seem silly and I dont want this to fall into the same category But I will find it and if it turns out silly then at least Ill be able to turn my wife onto a greatnooutstanding soundtrack When we met we went through this with Last Tango in Paris The youngsters I work with Im 56 respect my opinions but its hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little aged now I just cant figure out if the the aging process is the movies or me Friends is a very special sensitive and wonderful movie It will bring back a lot of special feelings Im sure By all means rent or buy a copy Indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today,1
During the Clete Roberts preface I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production however what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywoods Poverty Row and this makes the movie all the more realistic There are no punches pulled here and at times the film is reminiscent of The Well1951 The Black and White texture gives a newsreellike quality For certain younger viewers will be reminded of The Blair Witch Project but this one IS based on REAL events,1
Mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called Mom or with the word Mom in the titlebr br This is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out therebr br It is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisationbr br The kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger who just happens to be a flesh eater who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly is not definedbr br There is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by supplying food I shall say no more about that for fear of inserting a spoiler It is one of those quiet movies as opposed to guns blasting explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also inserting sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some socalled horror moviesbr br There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so innocent but what she becomes Oh my br br A gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan,1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively that is if youre immediately expecting it to be a horror movie Its like a riff on James M Cains The Postman Always Rings Twice at first Seki Kazuko Yoshiyuki is a mother of two and a dutiful hardworking wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo Takahiro Tamura But when hes not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji Tatsuya Fuji comes around to bring some goodies for Seki and a little extra Theyre soon sleeping together but after he does something to her lets just say a shave he knows that hell find out and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo They drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well Naturally this will come back to haunt them but that its literally at least to them at first superterrified Seki and then only later on skeptical Toyoji changes gears into the Kaidan a Japanese ghost storybr br This is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters In a way theres the mechanics of a filmnoir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century Japanese village as opposed to an American city or small town ie the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc Its compelling because Seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but illprepared Toyoji and her reactions to Gisaburos reappearances are staggering to her Take the one that comes closest to poetry Gisaburos ghost paleblue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for Seiko to get on the rickshaw She does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke Most Japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmosphericbr br While it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end theres so much here that director Oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work After hitting it huge in the international cinema world with In the Realm of the Senses which ironically got banned in his own country he made something that he claimed was even more daring that Senses Maybe he was right Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor also starring Tatsuya Fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread You can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two wouldbe lovebirds will go The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries the fate of their very souls is at stakebr br And Oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an American remake was already in the works and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the misenscene ie the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after I finish typing this ie Toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how Seikos nude body is revealed after she becomes blind Its daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and deaths connections to one another inextricably Its a classic waiting to be discovered,1
I am not a big music video fan I think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song Any song In other words creative thinking goes out the window Likewise Personal feelings aside about MJ toss aside This was the best music video of alltime Simply wonderful It was a movie Yes folks it was Brilliant You had awesome acting awesome choreography and awesome singing This was spectacular Simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man but was he a man or something sinister Vincent Price did his thing adding to the song and video MJ was MJ enough said about that This song was to video what Jaguars are for cars Top of the line PERFECTO What was even better about this was that we got the real MJ without the thousand facelifts Though ironically enough there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around Folks go to Youtube Take 14 mins out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is,1

I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies It is filled with Supersurfer Greg Nolls home movies and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50year passion Nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory It is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic Surfers are not astronauts nor testpilots Nor are they surgeonsperhaps or Phdsagain perhaps It believes in the quest of the surfer It believes in the beauty of human goofiness It believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before It celebrates the downtime of a country which fought a cold warinstead of a hotwar with the Russian socialists Surfing is the ultimate narcissism It is dangerous but only slightly historical I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received This movie has no military heroes It has no guns The only beachhead surfers conquer has a beerstand and and a surfboard shop This is not a problem Peace is not desperate It is the joy of exhalation,1

I caught this movie on the SciFi channel recently It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as Blist horrorsuspense films go Two guys one naive and one loud mouthed a take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky makeshift tanktruck hybrid decides to play catandmouse with them Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chasesuspense scenes Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horrorslasher buff Definitely worth checking out,1
Very mild spoilers a basic plot outline no real details br br IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland and the only reason I agreed to gowas because it was free I expected a few chuckles but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D not much more then thatbr br The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at Jack Blacks humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town The film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass the second half of Tenacious D We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name Finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled Pick of Destiny Again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face That said there were times it felt a bit long its only 100 minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot Which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or missand when they miss they miss bad Same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or sothen kept going anywaybr br I will say that the Rrating really saved this movie from bombing The Ds humor simply couldnt work without cussing sex and drug references But unless youre a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent Pick will make you giggle a bitbut is it worth 9 bucks I dont think so I was tempted to rate it a 6 but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres a 7 seems more appropriate Just be sure its your style,1
I shall begin with a disclaimer This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played FF7 the game before watching The movie relies on the audiences knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements And it does so very subtly Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise itll be that much betterbr br With that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever witnessed The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game on steroids Yeah The attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awebr br I believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music Again for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animationbr br Once again I myself having only played through FF7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix And that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized Like a dancebr br In short if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water If youre in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on Playstation or PC doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experiencebr br Finally I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film Characters move with fluidity Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot I urge you to reexamine the animation Facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot deliverybr br Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselvesbr br Thanks Square Enix The wait was well worth it,1

Things to Come is an early SciFi film that shows an imagined world or Everytown through 100 years You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts The film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the Boss wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again after Everytown was bombed and war broke outbr br This film only has about 3 faults its audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters arent deep at all and the overall plot isnt altogether solid The plot is lacking something that I cant put my finger on it just seems a little fluffy But if you love scifi and are interested in what HG Wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see Its worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing a long drawnout war because they were just about to go to war with Germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everythingbr br Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once,1
One word can describe this movie and that is weird I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting Well it was the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not Very strange if you are a fan of animationsciencefiction you might want to check this out,1
While i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem I dont know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever rightbr br The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting One of the girls is Alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle Thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving onbr br I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring But all in all a excellent movie,1
This movie is a riot I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies Ive seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny But this one is wall to wall great lines I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in The movie was nonstop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up Other than that its a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations Id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around You have to see it two or three times to get it all inbr br As far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that All the characters are great Its not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable No victims in this movie Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film You just wish that women like her really existed Shes not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbitebr br If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it I assure you the trailer does not do it justice They do not give away all the good jokes Just some of the mediocre onesbr br Oh and one more thing I hope critics put this on their top ten list Many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list This means you Ebert,1
A fey story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth Things must be pretty bad back on Mars Two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported UFO crash Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracys Pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby dinerbr br The diner has had no customers since eleven oclock that morning Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge The bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didnt notice who they were The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the journey to be resumed One of them is an alien but which one All of them are suspect Theres the crazy old man Jack Elam of course who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit Theres a blustering businessman who must get to Boston John Hoyt A young couple on their honeymoon Execrable performance by the husband Ron Kipling Except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else And even the couples are suspicious of each other Bride to newly minted husband I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin The story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the juke box turns itself on and none of it is to be taken seriouslybr br Its a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle There is no discernible depth to it Its not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens Its not a warning of any kind just a fairy tale that diverts and amusesbr br I always enjoy it when its on Its especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman Senator who masterminded the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGMs version of Shakespeares play And here he is with three armsbr br Oops,1
This movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space As a history of space flight it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it Disney has shown it on Vault Disney and I wish they would do so again,1

An extremely downtoearth well made and acted Rodeo Western No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60s and 70s West But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ups and downs of the hardnosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style He and Mr Coburn teamed up extremely well as partners not only on the circuit itself but also in the real world outside the corral Also check out Anne Archer as Coburns Native American love interest in the latter part of the movie Must have been one of her first roles br br Not as flashy perhaps as Junior Bonner but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal Thanks to the Encore Western Channel for showing this true grit of an underrated movie from time to time,1
Despite some reviews being distinctly Lukewarm I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as Mills and Boon so what It is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage I did feel though that Sir John Conroy who was desperate to control the young Queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain As it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of Victoria as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England which prospered as never before under her long reign I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie,1
Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixars A Bugs Life were immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when its in the right hands that is A Bugs Life is a warm reminder We walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalibre film productionsbr br It is only Pixars second animated feature The subgroup of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie Toy Story It was a movie which defied convention reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence Now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the filmbr br After all its a film about ants Well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bugs Life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film Surely they jest However we forget that in Toy Story a bunch of toybox items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounterbr br Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bugs Life from the beginning We shall start with our main character and our hero His name is Flik David Foley and his character is rather generic to say the least Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful Ant Island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his anticsbr br The problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper Kevin Spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands however its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil The cogs and clockwork in Fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppersbr br If you think about it A Bugs Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of Akira Kurosawas classic Seven Samurai or the American remake The Magnificent Seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies one lone villagedweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil In A Bugs Life the help comes in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a barroom brawlbr br Much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs Among them are an erudite stick insect David Hyde Pierce a sidesplitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug Dennis Hopper Its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs onscreen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact onscreen as is the entire movie collectivelybr br As Ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie What makes A Bugs Life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clichéd kidfriendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like However its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this filmbr br Although A Bugs Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here Pixar have proved that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood They raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves What more is there to say about A Bugs Life other than see it its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at Emeryville California but this beats out the lot of its year and Ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of 1998br br 8510,1
My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger Its about Andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her But of course Nicole isnt that easy to get along with she just started puberty im guessing She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time One day at the beach Nicole meets handsome Ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie I would give My Father The Hero 810,1
It is surprising that a production like this gets made these days especially for television Considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes not to mention lesbianism this has been given superb treatment and directionbr br The sets and costumes are flawless the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable There is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes The protagonist is really a tragic figure but not devoid of happiness Also this production avoids the mistake most filmsshows make when dealing with homosexualitylesbianism The characters are very human It seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on TV and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay Not so with this In Tipping the Velvet the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian meansbr br The BBC have made some wonderful productions in the past and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts,1
This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone On my list of favorite movies mental list mind the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series Spirited Away and Fly Away Homebr br I can really relate to the main character Jess At the start of the movie shes a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls She really sucks you into her life I also certainly cant fault any of the protagonists acting or anyone elses in the filmbr br The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules The movie is never boring The romance is really cute and didnt make me blush tooooo hard One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor Jess parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else The Indian people are also hilarious Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for itbr br Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film Theyre funny theyre refreshing and they make you feel good _,1
I know that youve already entered this in film festivals or at least I think you have I may just be making that up but I think this should get best animated short film in every one Bravo I cant wait for the full film I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations but hear it now and accept it as the truth Kudos my friend Okay now Im just trying to get ten lines of text Though I still mean it And here comes yet another SHOE and I cannot stop here yet This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do In fact Ill probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic Jason Steele Marathon I do have a lot of thosebr br R,1
This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action What sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated It was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well Why dont they use this rotoscopic technique more these days Its quite effectivebr br Fire and Ice in its prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy Some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore its esthetic quality I for sure did not mind Bakshi just loves animating lushious voluptuous babes as can also be seen in Cool World and I dont think he has to apoligize since its pretty much animation for adults But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot itbr br This one was just special so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since its possibly Bakshis finest For those who like animations with lushious women try Space Adventure Cobra as wellbr br I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10,1
I am not a Faulkner fan which is considered sacrilegious especially since I grew up near the authors hometown however I think this is an excellent movie On par with the quality of the movie To Kill a Mocking Bird If you havent seen it buy it anyway Its well worth having in your permanent collection TCM recently played the movie as a part of the Race on Film series I wish theyd play it more often Very movingbr br On a side note the folks from Oxford Mississippi will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940s The Courthouse City Hall etc Theyre all on screen I never knew the movie was filmed there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings When I saw the arch in the front of City Hall I began to get suspicious Look closely at the pennants on Chicks wall Youll see two for Ole Miss,1
This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever I have heard the Merman cast album the Angela Lansbury album I have seen Tyne Daly live and Ive seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times I think Bette is if not the best then tied with the best She captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of Mama Rose I was never a Natalie Wood fan so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in what is arguably her best role Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful The three strippers led by the alwaysdependable Christine Ebersole are hard to top There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back with Cher but I think Bette would be the best bet pun intended for Auntie Mame,1
Is it a perfect movie No It is a weird adaptation from a scifi book and it features vampires from space naked beauties and the British army efficiencybr br When I first saw this movie I was rather young and all I can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and Mathilda May Actually if it werent for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie I probably wouldnt have rated it so high but given her sheer magnificence I am now actually considering voting it upbr br Lucky for me I got reminded of the movie and watched it again now Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent scifi story but with completely over the top performances I still enjoyed the movie tremendously as well as Mathilda May but it was a mixture of nostalgia comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it endedbr br Bottom line if you are a scifi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie Oh and did I mention Mathilda May is young beautiful and naked,1
Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The OC but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tacklebr br BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose Here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other filmstelevision shows which deal with the subjects I referenced I think you will find at least something herebr br In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way I especially liked how they explained where the Cylons belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewersbr br The only real weak points I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress who plays Lacy Rand While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters but this is something I think needs work I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role This again could be down to experience and time needed to develop but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confidentbr br Based on the pilot I greatly look forward to seeing where Caprica goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once did,1
one of the best ensemble acted films Ive ever seen There isnt much to the plot but the acting incredible You see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in Italy and love And happiness The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women Truly enchanted,1
I havent seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me br br When asked about my favorite films this is the one that I seem to always mention first There are certain films works of art like this film Dark City and Breaking the Waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend This film shook me when I first saw it It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days,1
Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene but does not come anywhere near matching Bullitt Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his Mustang which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway now torn down and notices the Charger sitting nearbye you know you are about to see something spectacular From that moment on when McQueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing That shot of McQueens Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickmans rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact Hickmans look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect Then of course San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends Also Bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still Hot Mustang GT and Dodge Charger made for a better set of wheels then two boring smog device laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene Seven ups had a few jumps over little hills Yawn but of course they were not San Francisco hills The Seven Ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity Strictly Hollywood I would say except that it was filmed in New York,1
Night of the Living Homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11 Obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably Dawn of the Dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brainsbr br Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a 20 to a homeless man in front of his house More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park until the town is completely overrun with them This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgunwielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center But before Randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming I dont have any change Unfortunately the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people Then he becomes one of them asking everyone for changebr br The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem Unfortunately homeless people break into the mans house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself However he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in Fantastic Easter Special two weeks agobr br Meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless Randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the mans head When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out Randy pulls the triggerbr br In Evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica Californiabr br The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely rewatchable 810,1
Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula Sages touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline This gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think youve seen something special710,1
I read the book before seeing the movie and the film is one of the best adaptations out there Very true and faithful to the book Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing Robbins is a talented filmaker and I wish he would add more to his repetoire He made the film very haunting and intentionally slowpaced to add depth An especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end,1
DOCTEUR PETIOT starring Michel Serrault is a brutal story about a brutal man A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France even if their ability to compensate is not there Yet he preys on the weakest amidst the populace The imagery and cinematography are superb and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story He is the perfect psychopath Seductive and altruistic intelligent and caring calculating and murderous A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer Kudos to Mr Serrault for his chilling portrayal,1
I just got this video used and I was watching it last night The acting started out extremely bad heyheytwister but got very good soon after wards The tornadoes looked extremely fake and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done and just about on par with movies like Twister The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too The story was very well written and its refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old disaster formulas movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 yearsbr br While this movie had a very weird mix of FX and acting quality this merits an A in my book,1
OK Im Italian but there arent so many Italian film like this I think that the plot is very good for 34 of the film but the final is too simple too predictable But its the only little mistake The Consequences of Love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack Id like very much the lighting work on it The best thing on it is a great great actor You know if your name were Al Pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance But its only a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo Yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance its too slow its so boring so many silences but i think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni One of my favorite Italian films,1
If you only see one Ernest movie in your life make it this one This is by far the best in the series with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages The other Ernest flicks were good too but most people tend to get tired of him quickly not ME howeverbr br In this movie Ernest P Whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case The murderer Nash just happens to look EXACTLY like our bumbling hero Ernest Mr Nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him and so we get to see how Ernest reacts in the slammerbr br A great flick If you havent already seen it watch it,1
This is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it it has lots of laughs guns action crime good one liners and a decent plot with an over the top Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role as an Assasain Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the lead character Max a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent played by Carerra and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV plays the bad guy Livingston The plot centers around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies throw into the mix the Assassain Sutherland who pretty much has all the good one liners this is the perfect crime caper there is the usual love story but played very differently than you would think by Carerra and Griffith You also have the Russian mafia Italian Mafia and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix the film is shot in Boston where you have some great shots and locals great photography and music in this film this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy it has everything that one could ever want Check out Sutherlands toilet in a particular scene very unusual this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me,1

I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third moviebr br It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole I have heard many strange reasons such as a Because Yoda died b Because Bobba Fett died c Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d Because Darth Vader was revealedbr br I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely First off WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die Dont get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fetts name Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think Secondly many fans did not like Yoda dying Sure it was a momentous period in the movie I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic All the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yodas death Well nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy Why was Obi Wans death okay but Yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible That is utterly ridiculous I can not believe this one First off the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage They had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest The only thing they had was their blasters To add it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset Lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo Chewbacca and the Princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view And not only that the heroes of course always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters The troopers must have VERY VERY bad aim then At least in Empire Strikes Back the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers Dont believe me Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Landos base Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at somehow they missedas Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Starbr br The last reason that I care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed Well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father Annakin Skywalker It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete By Annakins revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker by removing the helmet The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about In fact thats is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Lukes fatherIsnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmetbr br On another note I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves I never go into a film with that deception in mind I always try to go into a film with the attitude that Well it might be better or worse that the original But I can not know for sure Lets see That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasbr br I am not sure who criticizes these movies but I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite that it is ROTJ I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbr br Bottom line the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above For example the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any daybr br Finally I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as This movie stinks because Luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunatelybr br,1
Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned Gentlemans Agreement which it beat to theatres by a few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying Its because Im Jewish isnt it Its much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical Somewhat shamefully the brief featurette on the Warners DVD doesnt mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an antiSemitic one but its interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish theres little doubt in Sam Levenes performance that the character is in fact also gay not a mincing caricature but theres definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with George Coopers confused soldier Theres not much of a mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guybr br Theres an element of Ealing Films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir Set over one long sweltering night the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laidback but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum Robert Youngs Maigretlike detective Gloria Grahames tramp and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly as her compulsive liar admirer a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryans excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row A big surprise hit in 1946 as a reward Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews So much for crusading,1
This movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved Its always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad Russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being foughtbr br Its interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the villains In this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who youre fighting against At first its kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the Germans are the evil villains But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in thembr br The way this story is told isnt however the best Its hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other The movie isnt always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who It doesnt always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European moviesbr br The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasnt even shot in Russia itself It helps to create a good war time situation atmospherebr br The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic But I dont know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism It also helps that theyre being played by well cast actors All of the actors arent the best known actors around Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personalitybr br All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production valuesbr br 710,1
I remember watching this series avidly every Saturday evening It was the highlight of the week I loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by Clannad I still have their Legend album I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin this time the Earl of Huntingdon I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors Im sure Robin and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those days Other Robins always look too old Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robins granddad The only sad thing was the ending its a shame they couldnt at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending,1
Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this abilitybr br No Too many are focused on John Lassiters amazing ability to steal other movies plots turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius but i digressbr br Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance Still Miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies childrenbr br That said I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew Link will sit still throughout the move enthralled a 7 year old my niece Amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus a 12 year old my nephew Aaron whos review was of course it was good Everything Miyazakisan does is good a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a 58 year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and Im betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child charactersbr br And that is what I respect most about Miyazakisan He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker On the surface Ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there a little boy names Soske somewhat like The Little Mermaid but there is an entire different level at play here True to form Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyos Mother Soskes mother the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willedbr br But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself Once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams Her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination br br Once human she teams up with her friend Soske whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham Soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human Frankie Jonas yes Hes related to the Jonas brothers Can we just get past that please gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young Soske which is good since he has the most lines His character is also strong willed but also very respectful and friendly characteristics youre not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacificbr br In the end Ponyos father Fujimoto must cope with his daughters decision and his estranges wifes wishes to allow her to be human He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will remember him fondly And once again Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy Although Miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet relatable No one in real life is completely a bad person All humans are various shades of gray And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters br br And then theres the animation itself In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was handdrawn and I for one was extremely grateful for that The character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience This is what animation used to look like and what it SHOULD look like br br In the end I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable Certainly not Miyazakis best in my opinion that honor is still held by Kikis Delivery Service but still a 10star fun movie for the ENTIRE family,1

THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most movergoers were stayathomes watching their new 7 Motorola televisions Almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation Obviously todays 10 movies will dominate In 1951 it cost 90c to 160 at Radio City 44c to 75c first run at Loews Palace in Washington DC or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs What counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash Instead 90 of the movies focus was on the music Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the bestever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO The result was a wonderful movie Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE Edmund Purdom took his place with Lanzas voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and notfat Lanza pictured in the advertising If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO its almost always on eBay for 200 or less Dont be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie,1
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances films While the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment The specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job responsibilityto save lives at sea The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowingI havent seen such angry seas since The Perfect Storm Costar Clancy Brown HBOs Carnivale great to see him again played the captain of the Coast Guards Kodiak Alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins The film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard it had the audience applauding at the end,1
The symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the bracelet the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story,1
I found this movie to be very good in all areas The acting was brilliant from all characters especially MsStone and Morissey Tramells Character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute The plot is interesting even though this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysteriousthriller like masterpiece Go see this film now it deserves better than what it got from the audience which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movieBefore it even startedYou wont regret itif you go see it,1
I would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing funfilled thoughtprovoking movie The absence of sex vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene but thats probably because I live a short distance from there Even so this film could have been produced in any city its the theme thats so important here Im just grateful that Manna From Heaven dropped down on us Try ityoull like it,1
I read the book and saw the movie Both excellent The movie is diamond among coals during this era Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw This film should have made them stars Shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film It could have easily been a franchise Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it You wont be disappointed Do yourself another favor read the book same title Itll blow you away Times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have,1

I was Unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80s I was born on may 14th 1994 Despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80s When other kids had playstations I was playing Zelda on my NES etc Now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review I because of my 80s style early Childhood watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest toobr br It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville Simon Seville Theodore Seville and David Seville David the Chipmunks adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack While they are talking Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the world Even though technically Dave is only going to Europe so to Alvin apparently only America and Europe qualify as The World David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller much to the displeasure of the boys Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller Later at a local Café the Chipmunks are playing a game of Around the World in 30 days against the ChipettesBrittany Jeanette and Eleanore After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile Alvin gets in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them They set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness Secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing teams likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there The winning team would then receive a 100000 dollar reward They do this because they believe that Jamal An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids However this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally And so begins a great adventure This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it It features great animation and topnotch voice acting not to mention the Kickass music Pardon my french P My favorite song is without a shred of doubt The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll An amazing rock song that cannot be topped Its also my favorite moment in the film Other notable songs include Getting LuckyKind of Suggestive for a kids film eh and My Mother as well as Wooly Bully and Off to see the world Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra The scene with My mother still brings a tear to my eye In relation to the song Getting Lucky I first didnt think anything of it but when I grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive That song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Princes men when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly highpitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child Anyway A bit after that scene the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband Ross Bagdasarian Jr know the characters better than anyone They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon as well as Dave and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses Nancy Cartwright The voice of Bart Simpson makes an appearance in this movie She plays the part of the Arabian Prince a very small but important role The ending is of course a happy one The Crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys Dave until he finally yells ALVIN and the screen fades to blackbr br Classic ending by the way I hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you havent seen this flick give it a watch Its worth the money This Nostalgic classic from

As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film a lot is lost Here director John Madden Shakespeare in Love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incompletebr br There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic The cinematography by John Toll Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall winning Oscars for both is splendid Working with Madden the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelousbr br Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment However by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isnt much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated While the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long By the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on featuresbr br Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight When fight he must Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personasbr br Penelope Cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic She allows the character to be objectified as Corellis love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own rightbr br John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine However Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagias fiancébr br I rated this film an 810 Despite some drawbacks this is a touching film that is well worth seeing The photography alone is worth the price of admission,1
My father grew grew up watching George Reeves as Superman and when I was a little kid he had episodes on VHS and let me view them including this movie passing them down in the family if you will and I loved itbr br Clark Kent and Lois Lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and its up to Superman to stop this mayhembr br Its just so wonderful and fun to view The old style special effects and sound the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology George Reeves was my hero when I was a little kid and Im 16 now it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are,1
This unpretentious Horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic Much much better than 90 of the Scream ripoffs out there I even hope they come up with a sequel,1
I read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but I felt that it truly transported me to Afghanistan a culture I know very little about I had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint I watched this with someone who didnt read the book and he also enjoyed it They had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film It leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over You feel for the characters and their plights I highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghani culture There are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch It is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime,1
In short if you want to watch Burt Reynolds best films than this one must be included If you dont like Burt you may still like this If you love Burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time Being from Atlanta it does hit home but its also nice to see a copactiondrama that takes place somewhere other than NY City Chicago Miami or LA The film is funny at points with good plot good performances from a great supporting cast every character is real the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought outA nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half it has some good old fashion shootouts fistfights no CGI thank God REAL ACTIONbr br If Clint Eastwood did his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with Every Which Way But Loose Any Which Way You Can then Burt responded with his best Clint type flick with this it comes off great,1
I have watched Love Jones over thirty times It is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be AfricanAmericans The dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty It was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional AfricanAmericans This is virtually an untapped market Love Jones was visually captivating as well The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present love The feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch If you hadnt guessed I loved it,1
This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched At the age of 12 I was up late and ran across the movie It was on the USA channel Gilbert Godfreys Up All Night I will never forget At the time my friends and I were really struggling with different issues some sexual You know 12 is a very rough and weird age It seems you are stuck in between being a little girl and being a young lady This movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me I now have a daughter that is 12 Have been searching for a couple years for this movie If it ever does come out on DVD I would be the first to buy Would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age,1
Holes is an awesome movie I love it a lot and its one of my favorite films Its one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isnt cheesy Holes is generally a very cool motion picture I wish Disney would make more pictures like it Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool Dont get the wrong idea I dont mean to bad mouth Disney but most of its stuff is aimed towards kids and THATS OKAY Children deserve to have their entertainment too But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail But not with Holes Its the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think its corny Really its the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate tobr br Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this,1
I cannot hate on the show When the old and better tech TV had to hit the bricks the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in Attack of the Show is the replacement for the Screen Savers with 3 cohosts in the beginning They were Kevin Rose Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane Brendan Moran came to be something of a cohost as well but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show Kevin Rose decided to leave the show and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host but that didnt pan out for some reasonbr br Eventually I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because hey this is what I read the two got married That was a big secret to me Now there is a new female cohost the notashot my opinion Olivia Munn Shes hiding something in those tops she wears while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasnt afraid to show itbr br AHEM Sorrybr br Attack of the Show deals with everything young people want to know about Its music movies comic books the internet and television This is whats great about the show If you dont want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV you can get all you want on AOTS Some segments and bits they do are funny They have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big namesbr br Even though the hosts arent as geek as Id like them to be I still have found Attack of the Show to be entertaining even with its latest lineup,1
Some people may call Cooley High the same sort of thing as American Graffiti but I wouldnt For starters in AG everyone was white whereas in CH theyre all black Moreover this one has a Motown soundtrack Specifically the movie focuses on several workingclass AfricanAmerican students in 1964 Chicago and their antics The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships In their apartments we see that theres never any dad around But these young men always know how to live life to the fullestbr br One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie But overall the main star is the soundtrack It is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history we even have it on vinyl here at home A classic in the real sense of the word,1
So wonderful so quirky so romantic so Italian The film is so feather light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again A kitchen sink world of bakeries and hairdressers and plumbing but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction Take your pick theyre both faultless Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass,1
This film is quite simply brilliant The cinematography is good the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking This is the story of Donald Woods a white South African who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid Kevin Kline is completely convincing so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV some years later I recognised him from Klines portrayal Denzel Washington also turns in a masterful performance as everbr br I urge you to watch this It is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story Remember folks this really happened,1
I have recently seen this production on DVD It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been I am a bit of a Jane Eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one I have recently reread the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly br br All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the Rivers family and their connection to Jane altogether I also think this is the only production to include the Gypsy scene done correctlybr br The casting is perfect Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book small plain and dark and I disagree that she looked too old Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable Oh to be loved by a man like that There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricksbr br Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre you simply most see this one it is simply perfection,1
In a time of bad if not plain awful comedies King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air its a complete oxygen tank It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times Nothing has been this good since Married with Children Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses And believe me it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius These guys truly understand what is funny I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldnt get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once Other funny people in this show are Carrie Janet Heffernan Spence and Doug Pruzan Carries boss Im so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem The show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers Check it out if you havent,1
The tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of Scotland winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead Michael Gaffikin James Warwick a former paratrooper in the British Army is the local dentist hes not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson Celia Imrie is always being viewed with a little suspicion not maliciously but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin The islands serenity is broken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman He immediately reports his gruesome find to Insp InskipMaurice Roëves at the islands police station Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP Dr Goudry for closer inspection A quick search for the killer proves fruitless as does a search for a missing local woman Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson a woman from the mainland who lives on the island through the winter months A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body her home proving to be the murder scene but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island one Colonel Howard Jonathan Newthwho also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry togetherbr br Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain With a heavy fog rolling in the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help the radio also doesnt work seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut Reports of UFOs and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach Inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikins idea that aliens might be involved but a rise in radioactive levels on the island has him doubting himselfbr br The Nightmare Man is based on the novel Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blakes 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both SciFi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board The Nightmare Man though is on the whole a succinctly better crafted piece that builds its plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor characters time is given to giving them all a firm background The island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over but its one that I enjoy very much the remoteness the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts In many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to Camfield he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times There is an authenticity about proceedings the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point If there is one negative about the killer its that we are given hisherits POV for the killings an acceptable cliché on its own but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer given the clues presented but its a fun and very well acted piece The local Scottish cast are exceptional the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold Imrie never one ive taken to in other works is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a Hammer production The outlandish maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers it disappointed me in some ways but taking into account when it was made its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it is even more terrifying,1
In dramatising Wildes novel John Osborne has condensed events eliminated a number of characters and generally implied rather than shown Dorians essential wickedness If you want a more explicit rendering see the 1945 film Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame but were certainly vastly different men and writers This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevensons Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy whereas RLS took the scientific route Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil with evil winning in the endbr br The actors in this BBC movie take a different route too from those in the 1945 film John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as George Sanders in his role really projecting Wilde himself but with a subtle difference Youll suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes Peter Firth too shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion but then we dont get to see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to displaybr br Its a very good production with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel if not all of its ramifications,1
This is my first Deepa Mehta film I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its Sita character presented as Nita I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not NitaSita Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta not her direction The characters big and small were welldeveloped and seemed quixotic towards the endsomewhat like the end of Mazurskys An Unmarried Woman They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men And one cardboard man Ashok seems to come alive in the last shot we see of himcarrying his invalid mother Biji He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion br br Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director however compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese microminority in the social milieu of India She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter not her father Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field Compare her to Mrinal Sen Adoor Gopalakrishnan Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giantsgiven her competent Canadian production team and financial resources Mehtas film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middleclass household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middleclass homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space Kannada Malayalam and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoersbr br Ms Das Ms Azmi Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors Mrinal Sens Khandar Gautam Ghoses Paar Benegals Ankur a brilliance notably absent in this film Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability All in all the films strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays,1

Director Edward Sedgwick an old hand at visual comedy successfully leads this Hal Roach road show which tenders a fastmoving and adroit scenario and excellent casting employing a large number of Roachs reliable performers Although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly sunny Jack Haley stars as Joe Jenkins a young Kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to Hollywood where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves starstruck Cecilia Rosina Lawrence Sedgwick who prefers using the entire MGM studio as his set does so here as Cecilia always ready for an audition is treated by a wouldbe paramour cinema star Rinaldo Lopez Mischa Auer to behindthescenes action of naturally a musical comedy featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interludes including their wellknown skit involving a tiny harmonica and we watch fine turns by such as Joyce Compton Russell Hicks and Walter Long On balance one must hand the bays to Mischa Auer who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star a role which he largely creates and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeleys filmic spectacles,1
The jokes are obvious the gags are corny and the characters are walking characatures but I couldnt stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie No matter how many times I see it I still get a kick out of this one and I recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment It contains many quotable moments and some of the best sightgags Ive seen to this day If youve had a bad week and you need a chuckle rent this one on your way home Friday night to give your weekend a good start,1

Like most I thought another crocodile movie So far weve had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months what can they do thats new Where both those films were about action and violence this ones about fear and tensionbr br The performances arent Oscarworthy when theres nothing going on but in times of distress or terror these people suffer so much its like torture There are holes in the plot and maybe crocs dont really behave like this as others have pointed out but the fear is so effective its a stretch to say youll enjoy this movie Itll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as The Passion of the Christ,1
If you havent seen this yet you really should on DVD I cant believe how much I enjoyed it It is amazingly realistic and believable True much of it is speculated and I would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts there arent many of them but it handles everything quite well with a Cruel Mother Nature theme It will remind you of the nature programs that youve seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel only the animals here are Dinosaurs They act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival You will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against othersbr br For the most part the effects are excellent At times they will look a little too much like CGIs but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic In some cases you will actually be convinced that youve seen a dinosaur My favorites were the Coelophysis the raptors the diplodocus the iguanadons the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds I was most disappointed with the TRex however which looked a little too computer generated at timesbr br In any case you should definitely see this production It is educational well made and very entertaining For what it is its an A,1
Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai India Sadhu Agashe is a hard working hardedged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers Imtiaz becomes frustrated by Sadhus high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhus tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politicsbr br I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India The camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds The acting pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director Shimit Amin has taken liberties with factual accounts Nevertheless Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of filmmaking,1

As most people I am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that Hollywood makes There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood Companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built inbr br This movie is a welcome change It could be classified as romantic comedy for its genre but dont let that turn you off this movie This is a very original movie which is not like most things Hollywood producesbr br If you are reading this you already know the basic plot so I will not bother going over that The only movies that come to mind to compare this to are Interstate 60 and Art of Travel which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the Hollywood garbagebr br This is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the samebr br Dean,1
Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow Although the storyline was rather typical of Claras later silents I still find it somewhat heartstirring and incredibly fun Clara plays a happygolucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she lovesnever mind that this man is married Claras lack of modesty was shocking in the day but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie Though definitely not a brilliant storyline quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of Claras ability to make the audience laugh,1
This movie has everything typical horror movies lack Although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers The only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for Jackzilla Dare i say oscar winner This is a perfect date movie I advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person,1
Having just seen Walt Disneys The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same manUb Iwerks The colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gagslike when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another ones off or when one dances with the other with part of that other goneare just as funny as the previous short It does get a little repetitious near the end Still Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony,1

Look this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies But you must see this just to watch Lisa Erickson as Julie She is SMOKIN hot and a great little actress to boot These types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson Nothing I enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a Coke and putting in this film My friends Bob Bill and Dennis agree Lisa is not only brilliant she is a hottie The movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard But as soon as Lisa hits the screen things really start hopping The others are clearly not in her league This is not the Exorcist but as I said if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress this is the one to see,1
I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldnt help myself I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in GB which is unique among Allens work along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoops most enjoyable aspect The plot revolves around Johansons character a journalism student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave She falls in love with a suspected serial killer Jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allenbr br I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johansons performance but I am a bit bias I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted She plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allens stereotypical neurosis stricken character She adds appropriate body language for comic effect Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johansons character sickeningly cute and that is a plusbr br Allen is Allen He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of latebr br Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the lessbr br In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion Johanson and Allen are more detectivelike than anything However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film Instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners I did find his allusions to his last film interesting Come for the humor laugh and be merrybr br Needless to say if you enjoy Allens work watch it If not watch something else,1
I rented this film because of my interest in American history and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his vision into a major world religion It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo Illinois It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith Within the course of that trial Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith Then Smith is assassinated and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land Despite his grave doubts he perseveres and finally has a vision that Utah is the place for his colony that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership Later as crops are destroyed by crickets he again doubts that he has truly been chosenhowever a miracle occurs which cements his place in historybr br I found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal Polygamy is a part of the story but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised The issue is not emphasizedbr br Im sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subjectmatter but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout,1
People watch movies for a variety of different reasons This movie didnt have the big budget theres no special effects no car chases and theres no explosions Actually reality doesnt have much of these either At least not in my life br br This is a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since Im neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brainbr br So watch this movie for the characters It is brimfull of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk br br Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Haydens life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie Excellent acting very believable br br Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his Harvey and Kiefers Mickey enhances the oppositeness of their charactersbr br I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady Mrs Ramsay Im sure she and my motherinlaw are good friendsbr br Theres a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them,1
A group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere one had a flat tire the others Jeep mysteriously wont start One of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him When the remaining foursome go in search of their friend they come across nice Mr Slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down hermitlike house which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins He goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house Before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warns them about Davy his brother who is lurking about and isnt all there Of course one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again Is it Slaussen Is it Davy The mannequins Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements jiggly big boobed girl goody two shoes girl curiosity getting the better of people and never working out but it stands apart from the rest of the 70s genre in its twist of an ending I started to feel sorry for Slaussen Chuck Conners is a terrific creepy overthetop performanceat a point in the film and you almost see the character of Molly doing the same This is a gem if you can find it I had taped it off of cable when I was younger and walking through a used video store I spotted a VHS copy that was totally overpriced but well worth it Fans of Tanya Roberts wont be disappointed either Best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup and crackersbr br I gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain,1
Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining AND memorable The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients This film follows three friends Gary Rick and David The Big Apple misadventures into the world of firsttime sex and true love Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship We follow hopeless romantic Gary The main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at its ending If you havent been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a looksprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace LAV truly is an original film a rarity among films of its genre,1
I loved this show from its first airing and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week The plot characters writing special affects were outstanding Then the scifi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining well written show I say bring it back I know all of the actors would come back I would suggest buying the DVDs I am I hope the scifi channels executives get word of these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers I only watch one show on that channel now Ghost Hunters but I am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too,1
I didnt know what to except so I think it was a lot better not having excepted much Dont get my wrong its not a bad short film Tess Nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film You can tell that it has been an act of love for her The acting outside of Dominic is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good There was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though I dont feel it greatly detracts for ones ability to understand the film If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do I say go for it The gag reel was fun I wont spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the DVD worth it just so you can watch it over and over If you like the film then check out The Pink Mirror a film also done by Jagged Edge I know fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven,1
This movie is awesome on so many levels and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome onbr br Just remember this When youre watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies be they good or bad THIS is the formula that they are using THIS is what makes zombie movies so greatbr br And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to knowbr br All in all it doesnt linger Theres never a point where you think to yourself cmon get on with it it moves quick and corners nicely This is the sporty little Italian number of zombie flicksbr br So awful its wonderful If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek rent it buy it love itbr br As a great trivia note If youre watching it on DVD youll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen underneath the musical score Well thats because that music was lifted straight from the trailer which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop,1
The Ladies Man is laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes including the funniest love song ever writtenbr br Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side rolebr br Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines youll find in any comedy out therebr br It is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time roundbr br I am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 47 10 and i urge you to vote br br And remember kids Theres more motion in the ocean,1
when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess2008 but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldnt just be a solid movie Almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shotbr br The only thing that really let me down are the performances Emily BluntThe Devil Wears Prada is the star of the film bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettablebr br To me the film feels like unfinished Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i dont know but thats how i feel about the moviebr br But overall its a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt,1
A flying saucer manned literally by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a forbidden planet What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself inbr br On the surface this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery Some compare it to Shakespeares Tempest but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre Stripped of what makes it a scifi film sure its The Tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about br br Underneath this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trekbr br Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful The special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable If it were not for the goofy retroartdeconess of 1950s scifi props you might think you were watching a 1960s piecebr br This is a classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi I like to call 1950s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effects The clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek Lost in Space and even Farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of Star Treks original series aired about 12 years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration While I do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem I had with it br br Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young goodlooking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles Unfortunately Nielsens performance is only average and at times downright poor especially at the climax of the film Walter Pigeon though quite excellent in other films overacts his role as well Ms Francis Earl Holliman and the amazing Robby the Robot are the standout actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job The problems with the featured performances I think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything Though they certainly got most of the film quite right,1
This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent centurybr br This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people not white black etcbr br Good movie with a good message,1
I have bought the complete season of Surface watched it in 3 days I was so captured by the the plot theories and basically everything about this show The actor who plays Miles is great Miles sister mother and father acted like real life family would You could connect on so many levels its fascinatingbr br I find animals are so wonderful you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child It would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly existsbr br Am sadden that Surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows I have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a bookbr br Love the show very much For those who havent watched Surface if you like scifi you need to watch this,1
Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century He is a true actor He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary Mary is such a beautiful woman Its her love that makes Rob Roy the legend but its his passion that makes her love undying They need each other Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find Cunningham disgusting The Scotland scenery is beautiful The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well If you like history romance passion and love youll enjoy Rob Roy There is violence and blood but its unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence And you do have to listen carefully if youre not used to a Scottish accent One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes Its their skill as actors that attracts you they dont rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal This is something special,1
When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world She has beautiful and charming body When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body i think male have hard to resisti think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes At least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in bandit queenI concur with what mallickab has said The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content Emotions arent conveyed properly I guess a couple of notsogood performances also contributed to its mediocrity In my view Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai In some of her scenes she looks a bit lusty which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed I also noticed a bit of overacting in some of her scenes Im a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai Cant help it sorry for that Raincoat was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat I was not at all impressed,1
I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time I have seen it well over 100 times actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching It is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in I highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again Buy a copy now it is a classic,1
I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning Im going to assume that ones level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on ones level of acceptance of Josephs storybr br However that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score If you get to Salt Lake City it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater I have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire lifeI wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there Being that Im LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few timeswhich I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started Anyway Im told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not he tells a fascinating story,1
This is one of the best horror suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decadesEven though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL THRILLS AND yes a lot of GORE HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS In parts it was sort of farfetchedthe acting was not that greatbut my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of tenif you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for youI have to admitit was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax I myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way,1
Created in 1928 and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name because his wife convinced him Mickey Mouse has become the staple of the Disney brand I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature Mickey it is in fact his third but it doesnt matter for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable The story sees Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and Minnie Mouse missing the boat Being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them Mickey helps her crank its tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until Pete comes along again to stop him making Mickey peel potatoes Mickey Mouse was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons Very good,1
Highly regarded at release but since rather neglected Immense importance in the history of performing arts A classic use of embedded plots One of my favourite films Why hasnt the soundtrack been rereleased,1
TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickfords films At two hours it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed Mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of Mary the innocent Mary the little devil Mary the little mother Mary the spitfire Mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past The movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting characters illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is thought the unwed mother in question If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922 no doubt the Best Actress Oscar for the year would have been Marys,1
Considering this film was released 8 years before I was born I dont feel too bad for overlooking it for such a long time Back in January of 98 though I attended the Second Annual Quentin Tarantino film fest held in AustinTexas The particular theme of films this night was Neglected 70s Crime Films and boy was her right The Gravy Trainor The Dion Brothers as it appeared this print was an absolute gem Wonderful performances quirky characters smart plot hilarious comedy and just an all around great time Rarely do you see a Crime film that is so entertaining and fresh Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well I hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it In the meantime go to an indie video store and hope they have it,1
The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group In their endeavors the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the big time who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life Though he could be accused of killing her he really kills only her spirit and will to live after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose The story isnt about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off then threatens him its about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be discovered back then,1
The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H G Wells great novel War of the Worlds This is perhaps the least wellknown and very probably the best of them No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th Century 1900 using Wells original setting in and near Woking Englandbr br IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers That might apply with some films where the ending might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in English literature so lets get right to the chase The aliens are destroyed through catching an Earth disease against which they have no immunity If thats a spoiler so be it after a book and 3 other films including the 1953 classic you ought to know how this endsbr br This film which follows Wells plot in the main is also very cleverly presented in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19thearly 20th Century photography Although filmed in a widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs rather than black Colors are often reminiscent of handtinting At other times colors are washed out These variations are typical of early films which didnt use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality even going from blackwhite to sepiawhite to bluewhite to reddishwhite and so on as youll see on occasion here The special effects are deliberately retrograde of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s and yet the Martians and their machines are very much as Wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel Some of effects are really awkward such as the destruction of Big Ben The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours Some aspects of Victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hairbr br This film is the only one that follows with some closeness Wells original narrative as has been noted Viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story Wells description of the Martians a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles is effectively portrayed When the Martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how Wells described them Both Wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural England plus a few scenes in London involving the Narrators brother The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark Big Ben but at least doesnt dwell unduly on the devastation of Londonbr br The victory of the Martians is hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines The Narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what Wells terms the rout of Mankind He encounters a curate endowed with the Victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality They eventually find themselves on the very edge of a Martian nest where they discover an awful fact the Martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene Wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful hooting The Narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate who revives just as the Martians drag him off to the larder cheers from the gallery British curates are so often utterly insufferablebr br This film lasts almost 3 hours going through Wells story in welcome detail Its about time the author got his due in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact A word about the acting Dont expect awardwinning performances Theyre not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you Most of them however have had very abbreviated film careers often only in this film The Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana in his 2nd film The Curate is John Kaufman also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing The Brother Henderson is played with some conviction by W Bernard Bauman in his first film The Artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by James Lathrop in his first filmbr br This is overall a splendid film portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds as Wells wrote it Despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hypedup competitors If you want to see H G Wells War of the Worlds and not some wholly distorted version of it see this film,1
Of the elements that make this the best at this point I have to say 1 is Christine McIntire Shemps scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent I imagine that as one poster suggested Christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at Shemps possibly dyingbr br Another character who helps this stand out is the Goon His look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good whos going to complain Not I,1
Everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else br br Any way I havent seen anything like this before so it was crazy Of course thats a good thing It is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one Like chicken little the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying Twas beauty who killed the beast War of the worlds scene and more Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one Also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema br br However some parts dont fit Like in the original lion king werent Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar In this movie they are not they were fighting the hyenas backstage Thers more the reason being why Pumbaa isnt so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also its just Timon Timon Timon Anybody realise that only Timonns story was told whereas pumbaa only had flashbacksbr br But apart from that ITS GREAT,1
Finally was there released a good Modesty Blaise movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter ODonnell You have a cover story just to tell about how Modesty became the magnificent person which she is It is not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the real tale Some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from 66 then is this a magnificent movie So are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story,1

br br I must admit I was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of Cut last night though was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem I am a true horror fan as true as they come and found Cut to not only be the best of the genre Australia has ever produced but one of the great parodycomedy films of latebr br My only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film was not overly clever in its application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in EVERY possible cliche of the horror genre they could I am certain this was intended as humourhoping this was intended as humourbr br And of course there was the gorebr br The use of the customised garden shears was brilliance besides the expected stabs and slashes In short there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the skeptics of this films worthbr br The appearance of both Kylie Minogue short that her appearance was and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic as well as Simon Bossell The Castle in a brilliant role as the jokey technicianbr br All in all I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as a beautiful satireparody toungueincheek till the very endbr br Loved it Go see it,1
I am so happy not to live in an American small town Because whenever Im shown some small town in the States it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless In this movie a former doctor whos just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash directs his steps to the nearest small town he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns which happens to be the Purgatory Flats And of course as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose He meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her But there is a tiny handicap she is already married to a very smalltime drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead To know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself Ill just tell you that its slightly reminiscent of U Turn by Oliver Stone but is a way down in all artistic properties,1
I always felt that Ms Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills Familiar to millions as the Lt on Law and Order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role HBOs Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna New York a suburb of Buffalobr br The story could be set in any major AfricanAmerican community of the 50s and 60s from Atlantas Sweet Auburn to New Yorks Harlem But the segregationintegration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nannys boarding house The story revolves around Nannys relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business I purposely did not say black actorsthis ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for Jimmy Smits of course I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day,1
This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes However we are talking about a movie where a hitman and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldnt come as too much of a surprise Brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden James Bond a role he was wasted in If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnans straight man Ive read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing My father a consultant nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a facilitator Much like Grosse Pointe Blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself,1
Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film It is starkly shot graphic without being visually graphic wellacted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer I didnt know what to expect sitting down to watch this a civil war movie or some kind of 70s softcore peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girls in the South But really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized as one reviewer previously noted none none of the characters are likable by the films end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic Eastwood plays Cpl McBurney a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdinyoull recognize that voice as soon as you hear it a girl at a school for manners headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that was the Civil War particularly in the South Soon Page teacher Elizabeth Hartman lovely young seductress Carol and even FerdinAmyhave emotionalsexual ties to Eastwood each having their own needs and secrets and problems Eastwood is not a nice man he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage In the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest The Beguiled for me is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front This might beexcept for Invasion of the Body Snatchers Siegels best film It certainly is one of Eastwoods best REAL performances page is always so very good and Hartman Fe5rdin et al excellent the Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic Some of the sexuallaced scenes disturbing And what happens to Eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film,1
Anyone who lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this film It is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a spring break movie PLUS it makes fun of the college film genre Its funny its got a cast to die for Amy Pohler Rachel Dratch Sophie Monk Parker Posey Jane Lynch Amber Tamblyn Missi Pyle and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud Writer actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain Wilson Phillips OMG Im just repeating myself now It will live on with girls who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending theyre dumb,1
Arguably the finest serial ever madeno argument here thus far about Earthman Flash Gordon Professor Zarkov and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet Along the way in spellbinding spectacular and actionpacked chapters Flash and his friends along with new found friends such as Prince Barin Prince Thun and the awesome King Vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Auranow shes a car This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget it is miles ahead in these areas Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few The production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for 1936 The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and firstrate We get hawkmen shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons octasacks orangapoids and tigronsoh myand many many other fantastic things Are all of them believable and firstrate special effects No way But for 1936 most are very impressive The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are wellwritten lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored Director Frederick Stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymonds phenom comic strip Lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial All too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents here most everyone has some ability Dont get me wrong this isnt a Shakespeare troupe by any means but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike likable job as Flash He is ably aided by Jean Arden Priscella Lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later The shorts Crabbeand unfortunately for all of us Professor ZarkovFrank Shannon wears are about as formfitting a pair of shorts guys can wear The girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful But for me the two actors that make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming officious sardonic merciless and fun Middleton is a class act Jack Tiny Lipson plays King Vultan boisterous rousing hilarious a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism Lipson steals each and every scene he is in The plot meanders here there and everywhere but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow Excellent,1
I have to say that the events of 911 didnt hit me until I saw this documentary It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there was any talk about the towers I was sick of hearing about it When this was aired on TV a year and a day later I was bawling my eyes out It was the first time I had cried since the attack I highly recommend this documentary I am watching it now on TV 5 years later and I am still crying over the tragedies The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing It was an accident and look where it got them These two brothers make me want to have been there to help,1
Perfect movies are rare Even my favorite films tend to have flaws Rear Window looks a little stagey at times Chris Elliots character in Groundhog Day doesnt work the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish br br The script is brilliant the acting is superb all around although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing the whole cast shines the directing and the photography are inspired and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative Every sad moment is truly moving every light moment makes me smile This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it br br I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people real feelings and real problems Brilliant A mustsee,1
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts and to be honest I didnt know how much I would like it I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised Driving Lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly Hes definitely one to look out for in the future Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity The highlight of the film for me was Evies rather colourful poem It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs In my opinion watching Driving Lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours The scenery was also striking especially the countryside Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable I strongly disagree with,1
For Greta Garbos first talking picture MGM wisely chose Eugene ONeills Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie br br Also wisely the producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast George Marion as Annas father Chris and James T Mack as Johnny the Priest transmuted to Johnny the Harp for films so as not to offend br br This little change is interesting Like too many films accused by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldnt be more faithful to the property By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldnt offend anyone or opening it up because they COULD too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place br br Fortunately the respect the studio had for both ONeill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marions generally sensitive screen adaptation Wonder of wonders Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbos Anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact What the League of Decency must have thought of that br br The source plays greatest problem has always been that Chriss friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage the two sides of the genuinely good woman men dont always recognize br br The perfectly cast Marie Dressler who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage as well before going to Hollywood is the perfect balance for Garbos Anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesnt allow us too much time to miss her one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from ONeill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Lavernes second act appearance in SHOW BOAT br br Anna and Marthys early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each others measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece Not to be missed br br ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama Its hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in 1923 also with George Marions original Broadway Chris could improve on this excellent filming br br The internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldnt be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the New York harborbr br Nearly all Garbos naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE 7 years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this ANNA Christie together with the variety of her 1932 films MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy NINOTCHKA Garbo laughs surely stand as her bestbr br ONeill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the US entered the conflict THE LONG VOYAGE HOME 1940 It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare nonWesterns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way,1

This TVseries was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid Even though I see it now through the pinkshaded glasses of nostalgia I can still tell it was a quality show very educational but still funny I have not seen the original French version only the Swedish I have no idea how good the dubbing was it was too long ago to rememberbr br The premise of the show was to show you how the body works I swear school still hasnt taught me half of what I know from this show It also tied in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and dont exercise with nice examples within the body Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you D The cartoon looked nice very kids friendly of course but done with care Cells viruses electric signals in the brain antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures looking pretty much how youd expect what they should look like in the animated bodybr br This and the series about historyespecially the environmentally scary finale were key parts of my childhood Im so happy I found them here,1
Fans of the HBO series Tales From the Crypt are going to love this MOH episode Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on will recognize this one right off the batbr br Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan also an excellent writer coauthor of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way He could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness In the case of RIGHT TO DIE he takes the latter approach and it definitely worksbr br Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist Robin Sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse Abbey Julia Anderson When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and shes horribly burned in a fire hes reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy Corbin Bernsen looking the worse for wear these days br br But Abbeys never been one to give up without a fight and thats where the ECtheme of the episode comes in Cuckolded husbands and wives have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky and OOKY supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception If anything the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewherebr br And thats not to mention that John Espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist You dont realize as youre watching that you only know half the story until close to the endthink WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas and youre therebr br Not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed As with most MOH episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply,1

They filmed this movie out on long Island where I grew up My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer which they told me was colored water tasted disgusting and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again especially in the funnel scenes Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form It never came out in the theaters obviously and it as far as I knew was never released on video and Im sure wasnt released on DVD Yet it looks like it was seen by some people albeit it probably very few So there must be something I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother yet there is no way I can find it anywhere Does anybody know anything about whenwherehow this movie could be purchased And which format that would be,1
Thats how Burt Reynolds describes this film which happens to be his best ever He plays Tom Sharky a vice detective whos on the trail of an international mobster Vittorio Gassman and the man hes financing to be the next governor of Georgia Earl Holliman In the novel by William Diehl the story is more complex because the guys running for president This is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story Reynolds doesnt do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films Hes very serious here especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong At times though the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobsters woman Only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax Just like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin Sharkys Machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker Julie London Flora Purim Buddy De Franco The Manhattan Transfer Doc Severinson Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams Al Capps handles the score with magic This movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever Check it outbr br Score 8 out of 10 Stars,1
Human Traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends it is a flyonthewall view into their lives and minds which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other There are many moments in that every one can relate to Like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers The characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie The situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in and that is where this film succeeds The topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other The story to the film is not all that but that is not a criticism This is a film about people This is a well written film with a sound track to die for DJs Pete Tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that I have seen in 1999 After watching this film I felt like I had been out partying all weekend Fantastic Movie Jo Brand as the voice of reality Need I say morebr br,1
This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch The second on disc one of DW Griffiths Years of Discovery DVD set highly recommended it features three excellent performances by the main leads and interesting to see Henry B Walthall The Little Colonel Birth of a Nation as a campy musician giving a Countess the eye and other thingsbr br The Countess husband goes berserk at his wifes betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour Its kind of incredible that they wouldnt hear the wall going up but hey maybe the wine had something to do with it Here Mr Johnson father of silent player Raymond Hackett gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama but in an unexpectedly comical way The best moment comes at the end As the lady passes out from shock and fear once she realizes shes doomed Henry picks up his instrument and fans it over her The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy and I just lost it and laughed my head off The expression on his face From that moment I was charmed by Henry B Walthall,1

I enjoyed it There you go I said it again I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age47 I think delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer If you like old school action and and explosions this is the movie to watch This is one of Van Dammes best worksbr br Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies get released theatrically where I live so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen,1

A lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to China Captures the amazement of films first audiences pretty much as its described to have been worldwide and uses actual Lumiere films for most of the actualities I dont agree with other people about bad acting on the British fellows part I thought he was fine but the Chinese lead really stole the show In any case I found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie People who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in English which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the Chinese on the DVD,1

I was surprised that Forgiving the Franklins did not generate more buzz at this years Sundance Film Festival There were times that the laughter at the screening I saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie The movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues You know little issues like Religion sex and the truth Lots of comedys seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations many leave you thinking I know they ripped this off from some sitcom This film takes off on its own unique direction I really think that Jay Floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film,1

Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldnt be laughing youve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wideopen mouths and glazen eyes you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the pointbr br But for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face Frownland really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for himbr br It would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronsteins film but for some insane reason I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer If someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out Stop Drop And Roll But with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body You endure the painperhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity I cant even begin to attempt to explainbr br Unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you But if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself bring a doggie bag,1
I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK where it was called Laupta The Flying Island I absolutely loved it and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it I was enchanted by the story and characters but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the Streamline Dub the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc boxsetbr br Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesnt have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original Japanese had and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead They have made some pointless alterations such as changing the main characters name from Pazu to Patzu and added some dialogue But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disneys moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking which I find annoying in many Disney filmsbr br This film still blows away most recent animated films and I cannot recommend it highly enough The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern massmarket homogenized animation,1
This movie is an amazing comedy the script is too funny if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this,1
Even this early in his career Capra was quite accomplished with his camerawork and his timing This is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately The first part looks like a Cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich prince will lose his fortunebr br Nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace its easy to get caught up in the clichés Then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living The ending is very predictable but satisfying I also want to compliment the titlewriting very witty and fun,1
This video is so hilariously funny it makes everything elsebr br by Eddie Murphy seem very disappointing even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor which just goes to show you how good this really is To be honest I dont think that Ive everbr br laughed at something as much as this including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse This show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F that is four letters long plus its extended version beginning with M but it didnt bother me See it the funniest thing Ive ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too,1
I never watched the Next Action Hero show and until reading the other comments here did not know that this movie was the prize from that competition I was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself watching dare eagerly all the way to the endbr br Yes the plots been done The Most Dangerous Game etc but I was hoping for and almost received the gotcha how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end I think the hightech was overdone GPSs and gave me coldsweat flashbacks of Night Rider but it nevertheless was not too overdonebr br The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD Suspension of Disbelief that was required of the viewer Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate Could a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and NO COPS show up Pleeease Way too much of that type of thing fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very muchbr br The final solution was good but the ending was disappointing with the after taste of a bad Star Trek episode At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy except for Zane who doesnt get near as much work as he deserves IMHO they were winners from a reality showbr br Knock me out,1
I just wanted to say that I love Gheorghe Muresan so I automatically loved this movie Everything else about it was soso Billy Crystal is a good actor even if he is annoying But the thing that made this movie was at least for a basketball fan seeing Gheorghe Muresan act,1
I thought that this movie was incredible I absolutely loved it even though my brothers didnt that much The special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row This movie just absolutely tops everything else I have ever seen It was everything I would expect out of a movie I just loved it Also it was pretty kidfriendly This movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible I would give it a pure 1010 It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies combined Absolutely amazing Loved it,1
This is a funny film and I like it a lot Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood to a tee This is of course the usual good vs evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham The humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still works well A comedy for a night when you dont want to have to think much its well worth a rent,1
The three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless Chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either Chaplins score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done The problem with this compilation is a minor one yet annoying The shorts have been stretchprinted to fit the 24 frame ps speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames ps This results is jerky motion that doesnt look very attractive and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time its just not excusable that the current DVD version is unrestored the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed There are separate restored versions of these classics available even on DVD and it would not be a problem to restore the image but alas this has not been donebr br A minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article but I say again a minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating The shorts are still worth 10,1

This little twoperson movie is actually much bigger than it looks It has so many layers Ive watched it over and over and always pick up on something new I am amazed at the depth of the acting and I feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that Alan Rickman is a major star,1
UK newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know Toby Young the journalist on whose reallife experiences this movie is based The key word here is based How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcombr br Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It This involves him selling out and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity However they are not overdone the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidneys misadventures The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid wellmeaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart moderately obnoxious skilled writer This contradiction is never that much of an issue because Simon Pegg as Sidney projects likability too wellbr br Jeff Bridges underplays Sidneys editor a little too effectively and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidneys affections And with regard to Megan Fox who plays an airhead bimbo starlet I can say only this just say the word Miss Fox and I will leave my wife sell all my belongings and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort Of course given that Im a fat 56yearold English accountant you might not find my offer too enticing but its there on the table anyway Given how short her career has been so far one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become however she does it sweetly with some skill and extremely sexily This girl will go farbr br There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the USbr br There are several laughoutloud moments and I smiled most of the way through As ever the Fword makes appearances when it really doesnt need to although at least a couple of these are very funny,1
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you You Are Alone is that movie for me The film is constantly in my head and in my heart I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if I am seeing it for the first timebr br There is nothing I did not like about the movie Amazing soundtrack The ending was perfect Very emotionally stirring It was compelling and rivetingbr br I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever witnessed I admired Brittanys strength what a strong womanbr br The tag line is When your darkest moments come to life We never know what we are capable of doing Everyone says oh I would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation We are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite partbr br Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art,1
I love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie Not just because Im a huge Linnea QuigleyJill Terashita fan but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at timesbr br The special effects are awesome especially Linneas scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessedbr br Plenty of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill plenty of humor cool soundtrack high body count etcBy the way if you have never seen this one try and buywatch the Unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing,1
Lorna GreenJanine Reynaudis a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club She falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon Its quite possible that through a form of hypnotic suggestion someonea possible task master pulling her strings like a puppetis guiding Lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that lovemaking is about to begin After the murders within her fantasies are committed Lorna awakens bewildered often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in realitybr br If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco Id say its elegant difficult By now youve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career as far as filmmaking style and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience And as you read from the reaction of the user comments heresome like this decision others find the style labouring dull and bewildering Ill be the first to admit that the film is over my head but even Franco himself when quizzed by critics who watched Succubus admitted that he didnt even understand the film and he directed it Some might say that Succubus was merely a precursor to his more admired work Venus in Furs considered his masterwork by Francofaithful because it also adopts the surreal dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesnt truly know whether heshe is experiencing something real or imagined In a sense like the protagonist we are experiencing the same type of confusioncertainly Succubus is unconventional filmmaking where we arent given the keys to what is exactly going on And a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesnt help matters Succubus is also populated by beatnik types and poetspeak Cormans film A Bucket of Blood poked fun at My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meets at a posh partyquite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually Great locations and jazz scoreI liked this film myself although I can understand why it does receive a negative reaction Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna a wee bit drunk writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindigequally wastedrush her in an embrace of kisses,1
This outing of Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever Frank Welker Welker makes the film Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty Knotts works for a small no where town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials When things go wrong the city fathers allow Knotts to take the fall Frank Welkers character befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and Knotts good name This film shows the usual Knotts scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film This may have been Knotts last good outing When you have an extra 90 minutes get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon Don Knotts,1
Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel I have not read the book so I really didnt know that much about the plot and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma The film also stars Toni ColletteWho has okay but has been much better Ewan MecgregerWho has also been better but he is still very good here Alan CummingWho I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and Jeremy NorthamWhos performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching,1
Thank God this wasnt based on a true story because what a story it is Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds Before The Devil is a mesmerizing jawdropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable and sometimes is even with or perhaps because of the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout if it werent carried out with such magnificent overwhelming conviction by its stars The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesnt hurt eitherbr br The main dysfunction here is of a family nature with the two majorly screwed up brothers brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke deciding to rob their own parents jewelry store an attempt that goes pathetically awrybr br The story is told with timeshifts which are noted on screen such as Charlie Two Days Before The Robbery so no one should be confused some people have said they didnt like this device but I thought it worked perfectly adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks between them you couldnt make a decent poker hand to save your life Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits one of the brothers is a drug addict married to Gina Marisa Tomei also excellent who is having an affair with the other brother toss in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father a wrenching performance from Albert Finney who has apparently caused him serious past pain and youve got a ShakespeareanGreek tragedy on your hands Proceed with caution,1

The movie was gripping from start to finish and its bw photography of the American heartland is stunning We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again Near the end of the movie the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face In the end we follow them up the stairway to their final moment br br The two criminals performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else Evil even the most vile is part of the human condition These two delusional men kill an entire family looking for a safe that isnt there Once on the run they start writing bad cheques carving out a trail for the authoritiesbr br There are many fine supporting actors I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case Alvin Dewey Also Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorneybr br I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through having only caught it in short snatches I did finally get to it after buying the DVD The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seenbr br Dont miss this brilliant movie To me this is what great filmmaking is all about,1
This is a great show with total freshness and innovation That usual chair couch for a woman host that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes the same old jokes the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer probably the pattern of Johnny Carson copied by one and all Latterman Leno Conan Daly this show does not seem to have any of thesebr br I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I am going to stick to it Though its too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest I hope that this show will last longbr br Returning back after months I still love this show and I love his selfdeprecating humor For example his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys which however does not involve the usual monkeying of Conan OBrien for example I know its a cardinal sin to be repelled by OBriens antics but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness br br I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it Ferensens spoof of Trading Spouses and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode are hilarious Idiot paparazzi are fun especially when a security guard cautions them against taking peoples pictures and if I am not mistaken they start taking his pictures shouting Gary Colemanbr br Added on 16th April 2007 Coming back once again I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog I cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing Either way it was funny as hellbr br I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages but maybe he does He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so I would better write down my suggestion here for him I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon the star of late night TV commercial I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spikes talk show sing a song and play guitar do a skit in the line of SNL and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles I know Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LAbr br God willingbr br Returning back on 14th July 2007 Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spikes talkshow must be bribed by Spike I confess that Spike really bribed me but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford,1
Its all about getting what you want when you want it And the message of Bluebeards Eighth WIfe is to be careful what you wish for until what you wish for wishes for youbr br Most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isnt relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue Misogynistic pirates aside Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it learning only too late that it wasnt what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty Claudette Colbert Through a twisted in soul and in practice business deal he ends up marringbuying her with the intent of bedding her but she will have none of it literally and frustrates him at every turn and corner and room and tourist attractionbr br The film has definite French sensibilities which means it has strong doubleentendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge youre not accustomed to and may not enjoy seeing in either Cooper or Colbert The whole reason I watched the film was because they are likable actors and the whole point of this movie is that theyre unlikable people or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves they think from the world br br If you can accept it on its own terms youll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated filmand satisfaction as we said is what its all about Such a movie with such a cast only comes around after all once in aummmblue moon,1
Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly Im appalled For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then im afraid i dont know what the world has come to Let me tell u something I started watching many TV shows like Lost Prison Break Dexter Deadwood and even Invasion But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season Then we have The Sopranos I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes There is no department that this show doesnt excel in Acting Nothing short of superb James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it wouldve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony The raw emotion he displays is superb Then we have everyone else Edie Falco Michael Imperioli Lorraine Bracco Dominic Chianese whom i remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2 and my personal two favourite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie Walnuts Gualtieri and Silvio Dante All of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode Then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a TV show before The story is nothing short of excellent Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show Not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i dont think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me youll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on TV After youve watched the first season youll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television and no TV show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos,1
Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists Fox which paid Judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer Well I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe Basically Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin Then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex which produces more stupid people By 2500 a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all faggy Seriously is this really that hard to believe Oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny oneliners like can we family style her and hey man Im bating here This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over,1
This is a great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was I can remember being freaked out by metal teens when I was a kid It doesnt help that I found a desecrated grave in my hometowns graveyard when I was ten Turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan So maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile but I love it now as a 24 year oldbr br I bought this DVD used for 6 bucks and I expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal And you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd This movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this ones for you 910,1
While not quite as good as A Murder is Announced which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book this is an excellent adaptation And you know what it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version Now I dont take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace and both of the above problems and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptations worst being Sittaford Mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement it not only respects the book despite a few liberties but it pretty much rectifies the problems the ITV version had Despite the added character of Lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book It is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent The performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general welldone script with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple and solid turns from Liz Fraser Helen Cherry Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde Overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all departments 910 Bethany Cox,1
This movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson br br In Japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio In the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her But is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share br br Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be,1
As if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC that fall in graduate school I read the book for the first time Some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film And for better or worseand Ive now read and taught the novel for over three decadesMilo OShea is still Leopold Bloom,1
This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love br br The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban historybr br The excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldbr br The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love br br The revolution like the film JULIE never seems to have an ending,1
I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey 60s Its politics too upfront and ridiculous And lets face it I was still under a lovespell known as BLOWUP and I still havent completely shaken it Now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well Good Luck to mebr br But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age And ZP is its own experienceand is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator the lategreat Mr Antonionibr br Twelve years ago I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size immense restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of placebr br What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its ownbr br I remember the second time around seeing it the early 80s I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular Whereas before these two seemed like a smartalecky shadow version of Zefferellis Olivia and Leonard read Romeo and Julietthey now were engaging me particularly The Girl in her insistent slomotionality Shetookhertime To Live Everything EVERYTHING dies around herbr br Upon exciting the theater the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new found enjoyment The encroaching shoulderpadded big haired 80s whispered But thats a hippie fantasy let it gobr br The force of Antonionis vision had I had realised already worked itself inside of me the FIRST time around so I answered 80s with an UhHuh and guarded my love secretly possessively and jealouslybr br But this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back secretly jealously and possessively And you get changedbr br Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup Undoubtedly ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment But hey sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at allbr br Today reality hit ZP has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of ALICES RESTAURANTbr br So it is still too difficult too disturbing too whatbr br Maybe its that as with all good art it Lives while everything dies around it br br Peace,1
This is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70s starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesnt make the cut as a marine Dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hardcore Marine Raider Geres character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of Vincents innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway Vincents character whose name is Marion takes Geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine Raider Marion hitchhikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwelllike little town In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins who immediately catches his eye Staying with Hudkins parents Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine Raider could still be so innocent The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps as the towns folks go hunting 3 escapees Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt But theres still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit I would have preferred a little more drama Anyway this captures JMV at the peak of his 70s performances BUSTER AND BILLIE BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid70s were amazingly good JMV performances He was both an action star and a heartthrob all at the same time He made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80s with the great TV show Airwolf He does a very good job in this as Hedge quietly observing the way people treat him in his uniform as he travels across the country He must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movieand it looks like hes the guy getting tossed down the river to me But really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with JMVs talent and his looks Innocence can only be so interesting Evil as explored in Buster and Billie is much more dramatic Anyway Glynnis OConnor is delightful as Rose The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting The outdoor scenes are gorgeous must have been filmed in Canada,1
Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories The music is great you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like Ive been there too and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion Cashs narration is good toobr br Butbr br 1 The actor who played Jesus was miscast 2 There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music 3 Because it is uncompelling I doubt well see this ever widely distributed againbr br Id love to buy the CDbr br Tom Paine Texas USA,1
Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarvas most political movies It takes stance strongly against modern day societys authority status in the life of the common man and how it has estranged men from the nature completely It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare societybr br Vatanen Antti Litja smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern Finland only to realize that the concept of a free country isnt all that unambiguous in other words the society has the common man by the ballsbr br Still the thing that makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional besides the visual and humouristic brilliance is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 70s as well as the whole identity of Finland as a nation Vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us Finns the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving,1
After seeing Dick Tracy in the 699 bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies I was very surprised to see a very fun smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout The movie moves along well it has of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city Madonna was great as the damsel in distress she really impressed me and added depth to her performance If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try I dont think you will be disappointed And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino James Caan Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others,1
Send them to the freezer This is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film The complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile if you can stand it Definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive,1
Wow I picked this off the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in Trainspotting This is a phenomenal movie it has action romance suspense intrigue and wit When I wasnt laughing I was at the edge of my seat This is definitely a film I would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century This film has everything to keep ME happy,1
I dont know why some people criticise that show so muchbr br It is a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but stillbr br The family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried Roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have subplots or oneliners that make you roll on the floor laughingbr br This show was well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for itbr br rating 810,1
I found this to be a surprisingly lighthanded touch at a 1950s cultureclash movie John Wayne would hardly be ones first choice as a cultural attache being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bullrun in Harrods But this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplished his task with style The Duke was a guy who really could act well His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtlebr br Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie Many of his good intentions came a cropper He had authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarianbr br The story of American attempts to curry favour with an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hellforleather battles I cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well There was a great deal of minutelychoreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props The set pieces were complex and detailed A lot of money and thought had been applied to itbr br The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flagwaving effort Script was good without being too wordy There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didnt interfere with the narrative It was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set Whether or not they were Japanese I couldnt say But anyway they looked the part At least the leads were not played by crossdressing Caucasians unlike other efforts such as Blood Alley yes I know they were Chinese The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness or even The King And Ibr br Frankly I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies The script was better for a start I never liked the songs in The King And I and wasnt impressed by the heavyladen anticommunist subtext of Blood Alley I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Dukes more popular outingsbr br Recommended,1
I was so glad I came across this short film Im always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting forbr br The plot is pretty simple the director writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchybr br Its a well made short film well edited and the actors all do a great job And the last shot of the film is perfectbr br I highly recommend this film,1
OK so it owes Pulp Fiction but in my opinion has its own voice and identity mainly because of the musicvideo direction style sketchlike narrative and great performances Thomas Jane delivers great the drugdealer showdown is extraordinary Aaron Eckhart likewise James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearancegreat humorthey got the Wong house The Porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable as is Mickey Rourkes cameo appearancetake a peakbr br Great Hollywood popcorn Bproduction with strong performances of Alevel aspirants and renegadesRourkebr br Well take a peak its worth,1
As far as I know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal Id agree with him This is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boyman with a special body part helping him Oscar and BAFTA winning and Golden Globe nominated Daniel DayLewis plays Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and carried by his family He has a special left foot though he can write with it paint with it and hold things with it He learns to speak later in the film it is very good for a guy like him Also starring Home Alone 2s Oscar winning and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally as Mr Brown It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan Best Writing Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay Daniel DayLewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors he was number 9 on Britains Finest Actors and he was number 15 on The Worlds Greatest Actor and the film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films Outstanding,1
The story has been told before A deadly disease is spreading around But the extra in this film is Peter Weller his interpretation of Muller on the run is real He is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child This person could be working next to you,1
As far as I know this was my first experience with Icelandic movies Its such a relief to see something else than your regular Hollywood motion picture Too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world I can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or otherbr br Because its really worth while I left the cinema feeling really sad I couldnt get the tragic destinys of the characters out of my head And it impressed me even more when I thought of the complexity of the film Not only was it a tragic story it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrackbr br If you have the opportunity watch it Its really thought provoking and made me ponder a lotbr br,1
Very typical Almodóvar of the time and in its own way no less funny than many of his later works And why is that There is nothing to be provoked or shocked about and I guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional No the great humor stems from an underlying almost surreal absurdity that is woven into the scenery The characters nearly complete lack of taboo Its the same kind of comic suspense you find in his later works though youll find it in a more rough version here Hes building up for masterpieces to come but is not yet therebr br The sole reviewer who commented on this movie before I did claimed that it had to be a very select group of people whod find this movie hilarious I do,1
Once again Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load It has humour Youre just making it up as you go along Yup but I do it brilliantly action monsters in this case still more kickass cybermen tragedy and scare tactics In short just what the doctor ordered pun intended The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of get on with it So chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh then made you cry and made you go eekbr br In terms of character development this is clearly the clincher for Noel Clarkes Mickey and Ricky Being one of the Doctors companions you know that he will do the right thing and may even suspect the manner that he does it However it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future pathbr br While The rise of the Cybermen had more of the sinister build up to terror The Age of Steel is an all out blast Like Alien compared to Aliens both true classics but in different ways Can the series keep it up at this level Lets hope so,1
A Brothers Promise is a wonderful family film This is a biography of Dan Jansen a champion Olympic speed skater The movie depicts this athletes life from a young age through full adulthood The love and support of the family members is evident throughout How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us The commitment and determination of Dans coach and his teammates shows what it takes to make a real team How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating The faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age,1

I loved this film I thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget I ran out after watching this to buy the DVD obv not easily forgottenbr br The script is brilliant and the casting couldnt be more perfect Each character has their moment and I laughed hard throughout this film comedic timing was spotonbr br,1
First of all I should point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary Not only it had great music in it but the shots and the editing were also wonderful However all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist East meets West cliché that bothers many Turks like myself Okay this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds However the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as east from the eyes of the west I mean like one jazz musician says in the film maybe there is no east and west maybe it is just a myth a lie created by the ruling leaders of western countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and keep the cash flowing br br Why dont you think about that,1
i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie the character of gustplayed perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory this movie informedyet managed to avoid preaching to the audience it made me laugh made me sad made me feel alive and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie it takes no time to understand what is going on and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion i thought i knew my history apparently i didnt know it at all i give this move 9 out of 10 and recommend it for all adults and young adults and the young at heart just not the young but as soon as they are allowed to see r rated movies make it a priority,1

and I for one think that is a good thing Ive just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making thisbr br As for the rest of the production I think it was slightly less than the original movie One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratchy fingernailsontheblackboard voice belting out HEY It takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah and although I missed it I was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copybr br I also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the moviesbr br I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song Let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it,1
So real and surreal all in one I remember feeling like Tessa Heck I remember being Tessa This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending I especially liked the protesters tangent It is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it If you get the chance to see this take it It is well worth the 30 minutes,1
A friend lent me this DVD which he got from the director at a festival I think I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this moviebr br The standouts where the actors Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie the main character kind of pathetic in a likable way Adam Jones who also directed and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad The Bill character Justin Lane who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda was by far my favorite he seemed the least onedimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD Really kind of lovable and very funny Some of the other acting was good some was soso but none of it was bad I also really liked the vigilante duo Ridiculous and funnybr br Im giving this one high marks even though it has some issues because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared and decided to make their movie their way Well done to Adam Jones and crew,1

Cinemas greatest period started in postWar Europe with Italys NeoRealist movement During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed Frances New Wavers caught everyones attention and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces But in 1971 Luchino Visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work Death in Venice which might as well be called The Death of Europoean Cinema After the Sixties wound down so did the great European filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats Coppola Scorsese Co This movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of Viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies And rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the Visconti revealed here Hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind The pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight Incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmosbr br We will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale Thomas Mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it Visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role Dirk Bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background Gustav Mahlers 5th Symphony Taking full advantage of Mahlers ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast Visconti changes the main character Aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk Bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsebr br Cinema just doesnt get better than this Ill ignore the complaints from the Ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced The flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers Of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something And what its mostly about is suffering Romantic capital R suffering in particular As a suffering Romantic himself Visconti knew whereof he spokebr br SPOILER I guess If for nothing else see Death in Venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with Bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face Meanwhile off in the distance young Tadzio the object of Bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty Death in Venice is a miraculous work of art br br DVD tip as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece The Damned I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie Its ostensibly in English but the DVDs sound seems muddy and theres a lot of Italian spoken during the film anyway br br,1
This production was quite a surprise for me I absolutely love obscure early 30s movies but I wasnt prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story If by any chance youre not convinced in the first half hang in there for the finale Of course you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical A fascinating viewing experience but I think THE CATS PAW is not available on videoDVD yet Watch your PBS listings,1

This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped Though I will concede that the ideas behind Batman Forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director as it turned out this was not to be the casebr br Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series I fail to understand how Batman Returns can be considered at all disappointingbr br True it is not quite the equal of the first film though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in Batman a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film true to the way the Batman was always meant to be and highly satisfyingbr br Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck Christopher Walken named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor his partnerincrime Oswald Cobblepot the Penguin Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Oliviers Richard III and Selina Kyle the Catwoman Michelle Pfeiffer whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman The four principals turn in excellent performances especially Walken and DeVito while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identitiesbr br There are some intriguing concepts in this film About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a fourcornered fight There simply isnt enough time to properly explore whats going onbr br Nevertheless this is a damn good film I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton,1
I was stunned by this film Afterwards I didnt even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparisonbr br For many it may be the worst of Antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of Wenders verbose confused transcendentalism It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders typical meandering heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinemabr br But for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of thingsbr br,1

This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film Ive seen in full the first was Rope which I really enjoyed With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas Rope took place all in one room I didnt enjoy this one as much as Rope but thats not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something morebr br It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones As a thriller I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension The sound design is almost non existent You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing Intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty insidebr br The film doesnt feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot movingbr br The performances are there but nothing amazing Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work The one stand out is Otto Kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down patbr br In the end I wanted more from this one I understand its one of Hitchcocks least exciting films but I did have a good time watching it I can recommend it just not enthusiastically,1
It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film I read the book before and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible The qualities of the book havent been lost the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sues point of view then from Mauds one The main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each otherbr br For each of her books the author Sarah Waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense,1

For a long time The Menagerie was my favorite Star Trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by City on the Edge of Forever What I used to prefer about Menagerie was that its more hardcore Star Trek with this fascinating backstory to the thencurrent Trek storyline I still think its fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a twopart episode Though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of Spock being courtmartialed is a clever one You can poke holes in the plot if you want For instance given the Talosians mindcontrol abilities and Captain Pikes condition why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy STs only twoparter,1
If youve read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much as I did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonnguts writing that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself and that you cant put a human mind on the screen His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen Does this mean that the movie misses the mark Of course not In my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of Americas true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense Ive seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonneguts genius and loses grip on his own craft I would not place this movie as one of the best Ive seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching By taking Vonneguts voice out of the movies narration or trying to insert it however it can Mother Night tells his story brilliantly and preserves the storys fundamental lessons without confusion distraction or disappointment,1
A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released I think that the difference didnt matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy We can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but its less clear why hers would be attracted to hisbr br Still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy The scene where she stares at him across the cats head with her dark paintedon eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic Its a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building and we see the age difference very sharply As he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee,1
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about One man Daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity The kids grow upone all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances Yes I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent This true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents A must see for those who care about their families,1
The only conceivable flaw of this film is its title Please stop comparing it to the first I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first If you havent seen the movie and are curious TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own This is a great exponent of screwy mid80s comedy I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus I maintain the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title I usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically I dunno maybe its like a bad relationship I cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure Either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind The Stunt Manbr br Robert Stack WE LOVE YOU 19192003,1
Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives We see them panhandling in a car of the underground where their pitch to get donations is so lame no one gives them anything Salva who is a hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination something that Salva capitalizes onbr br He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show He transforms himself into a Christlike figure who is an instant success in the program Espe who is a nononsense woman who is shows producer cant escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention Ultimately Salva is the victim of his own success in the endbr br Jordi Molla whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television Spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audiencebr br The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film Mr Molla like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera Candela Pena a good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie Juan Carlos Villedo David Gimenez Cacho Franco Francescoantonio Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director,1
These kinda movies just dont get the credit they deserve This is my 2nd all time favorite movie Stand By Me being 1st The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and I think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did Sean Astin I just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me Everything in the movie is very exceptional The script the acting the screenplay I was on the edge of my seat 80 of the time and if my mom wasnt in the room I would have absolutely balled whenever Joey Trotta Wil Wheaton died I did not see that coming At all I was real surprised when I heard that it wasnt real popular back in the 90s I was born a few years after it came out so of course I didnt go see it in the theaters but im sure I would have if I would have been alive If any of my friends watched this they would be like uhh okay but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this If you havent seen this movie or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb this is the movie for you to watch,1
As a bigtime Prince fan of the last three to four years I really cant believe Ive only just got round to watching Purple Rain The brand new 2disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it Wow I was really looking forward to watching it but I wasnt prepared for just how electric it actually is Princes musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding he REALLY has the moves in this one I am very familiar from repeated listens with the classic Purple Rain album and all its songs but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics like COMPUTER BLUE THE BEAUTIFUL ONES WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform The closing songs BABY IM A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince was brimming with in his mid20s hes overflowing it blew me away It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak yearsbr br Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams drive her to a lake make her jump in then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsightbr br Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the films overall charm Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious and when his group The Time perform THE BIRD you get to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the stage Minneapolis funk style I love their dancing in this bit and how Benton provides Morris with a mirror midperformancebr br I already cant wait to watch it again I really cant Extras are terrific particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy preBeverly Hills Cop admit he is a Prince groupie,1
After several extremely well ratings to the point of SUPERB I was extremely pleased with the film The film was dark moving the anger the pain the guilt and a very extremely convincing demonbr br I had initially expected to see many special effects and like a lovers caress it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it Brian I am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects You will go a long way my friend I will definitely be the president of your fan clubbr br Eric Etebari the best actor award was the number one choice You made Jr Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya br br Overall the acting story line the high quality filming and awesome effects it was fantastic I just wish it were longer I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations,1
But it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on Weird Al like I did Its a mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins Its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to Japan Although its not quite as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is Tokyo street lifebr br Perhaps Weird Al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet Still this is a funny movie,1
One of the two Best Films of the year A well filmed well written well put together film with an outstanding cast Lau Ching Wan and his friends Dayo Wong Chi Wa Anthony Wong Chau Sun Francis Ng Chun Yu Jordan Chan Siu Chun Cheung Man Tat had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances Theresa Lee plays her comedic role well Though much like a female version of Michael Wong her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers and I found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes something I havent done since 1 the fan boys took over altasianmovies and 2 John woos Hardboiled Sure the ending was expected but I feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members Highly enjoyable,1
I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving It was very well directed with strong imagery The visual effects were amazing especially for a short It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father There is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard This leans towards the Gothic feel I would love to see this as a full feature film Carrie,1
A wonderful film ahead of its timebr br I think so In the eightys it was all about winning Greed is Good Remember that one I have seen this film more that 20 times To me this is a real desert island film I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin are simply wonderfulAlso Beverly Dangelo Beau Bridges come in at a close second dont get me wrong there are many more great performances in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and I hope you a film that you will want to see over and over I think TV shows like Northen Exposure and now Earl owe a lot to this film but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film,1
This is one of my favorites Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy One is a business executive who reevaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year The other is a playboy who has tired of golddigging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital mature woman If youve got silver in your hair andor romance in your heart microwave the popcorn curl up with your honey and prepare yourself for a treat,1
Following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the mans legacy is exactly as such In direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties The change of setting isnt just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle Yet as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that Part Two takes a much more refined callous and bleak segment of Ches life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible easy to grasp mannerbr br While the movies tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible This somewhat distant cold approach to telling Ches story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything the entirety of Che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a mans struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast Che is a slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably conducted the whole thingbr br Yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of Cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesnt feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points Here the basic structure of Part One is echoed backtheres the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement Yet as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know Part Two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming and disquieting note This difference in combination with the similarities to Part One make a compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be digested one their own and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement Che delivers exactly what it sets out to achievebr br Indeed everything that made Part One the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with a feature such as this Part Two once again proves that avoiding such elements dont necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged In fact upon writing this review I was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One and title the review as a whole yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutivelybr br With that said I cannot rightfully decree whether or not Che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments I can at least attest to each parts ability to do just that With a reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movies characters without drawing attention to themselves Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of filmbr br A review by Jamie Robert Ward ,1

I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes up until two years ago when I first saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema which I found interesting to put it diplomatically but not so special I instantly wanted to see more of his work Since then I tried with an emphasis on tried watching his other work SHADOWS in particular I must admit it took me a a while before I actually enjoyed the film At first the unpolished raw and improvised way Cassavetes it was shot put me off somewhat and I thought of it as an original absolutely but flawed and dated experiment But now upon reviewing these little imperfections make it look so fresh even todaybr br Shot on a minimal budget of 40000 with a skeleton six person crew SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an AfricanAmerican family in which two of the three siblings Ben Ben Carruthers and Lelia Lelia Goldoni are lightskinned and able to pass for white Cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones Cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing a reaction against seamless Hollywood production values Cassavetes main inspiration at least in the cinematic style the film was shot were the Italian neorealists whilst also professing admiration for Welles pioneering spirit The use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the Italian neorealist directors but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus ans Shafi Hadi the film feels very different very American unlike anything made before really br br The song with the feathered girls I feel like a lollypop or something feels like light years back to me ancient history But no matter how dated it might look it still makes a delightful time capsule of late Fifties New York today I think its this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film without Hollywood improvised and without a real budget Seymour Cassel who acted and was involved in SHADOWS claims it was Jules Dassins THE NAKED CITY 1948 that was the first and inspired them all but I think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakersbr br Camera Obscura 810,1

This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say Enough already Of course it isnt nearly as beautiful as Woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes Eric Phillips Don Wilson is an undercover cop in the near future When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a lookalike cyborg it is up to Eric to clear her name Wilson gets to pull Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me Being a PM production there are tons of car chases exploding cars 4 in the first 5 minutes and shoot outs I particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Dons simulator It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995,1

I have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against Iranian people if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that Im against politicians in general but if youre looking to be offended I cant help youbr br Not in Iran as this movie is banned there see IMDb trivia for this movie Which is a shame because the movie is great Would it not be for Grbavica this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlinbr br Rightfully so it was the runnerup or second place if you will Why Because it is a movie about oppression Its not even that this is a complete women issue It is about the government trying to keep the people down An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie But by banning it nothing is resolved andor can they make this movie disappear br br Another reviewer had a great summary line Comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well,1
I know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless I was at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killers The plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and as you know Saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place makes complete sense and its then that you know you arent simply watching another silly 80s slasher with a pea brain plot Thank god for that Seriously though Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with its originality Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone I know what Id choosebr br Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think its silly plot dug it into is the fact that its extremely entertaining Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore This film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids which harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry Theres nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again cough Halloween cough but thats not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows There wasnt any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it,1
After many many years I saw again this beautiful love story thinking about how would I half a century after react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time when I was just an male adolescent trying to understand womens behaviors in a small city in Brazilbr br This time however what caught my attention in the film was something very different namely the insistence with which the physician Dr Han Suyin Jennifer Jones makes clear to the journalist Mark Elliott William Holden her special ethically condition as an Eurasian In fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provided that by doing so she is not betraying her Chinese side Its seems to the spectator that Suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control thembr br Therefore Suyins attitudes always leave poor Elliott a determined brave and extremely practical man anxious and perplexed without knowing how much importance to give to her words For him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear if we love each other let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together Not so fast is what she seems verbally and nonverbally to answer him all the timebr br In fact Suyins Chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism And as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind namely the constant raids on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or nonphysical world For Suyin is always alerting Elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and concrete threat as would be the perpetuation of the English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beingsbr br In fact it looks like a whole bunch of Chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make peoples life totally miserable Because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon peasants are advised that they should shout loudly The rice is bad The rice is bad to protect their crops from being stolen by deities and in a funeral it is recommended that the deads family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods dont take advantage of their sorrow and fragilitybr br In other words Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyones daily lifebr br As the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949 it should be clear that China really was at that time almost a semifeudal society while the country from which Elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the USA after the first oil shock in 1973 took charge of the whole world Therefore at least in one aspect both sides of Suyins Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be todaybr br A lot of History came into being since those old days As to China the main fact is that after several phases of a communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as State capitalism And what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled Suyin in Hong Kong in 1949 and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned Elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital It is gone completely gone In brief if that story took place today Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family In fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talking business as usual,1
First and foremost I would like to say that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual Someone that cared about others appreciated others found nobarely any judgment against other people and this film has i think changed my life or viewpoint dramatically When i watched it I didnt know particularly what it was about i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that I was clueless and as I began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters i was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise The first time i watched it i was blind Blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness as human beings to their relationship I watched it a second time because i finally figured out how hypocritical I was being saying to myself and others Oh i accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear I suppose The second time I watched this film I opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that Id heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love And I loved it i loved the storyline i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film i loved the sharing of feelings and i loved the strong bonds created It is a really eye opening beautifully done film that made me cry at times and I hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserves love no matter what shape or form it is presented in,1
Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heartstirring Daniel DayLewis is a chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experiencebr br The movie is not so pessimistic as I thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing Christy is not despised by the normals his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyesbr br One important factor of Christys success is his mothers support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role this fat little middleaged woman uses her all to make Christys dream come true So lucky for ChristyAnd Hugh OConor is also excellent as young Christy what a performance for a child The love story of Christy is very welldone trustful Christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful Dr Eileen Cole surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series the loathsome Aunt Petunia so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is paranoiac and offensive I do have sympathy for him love is a twoedged sword happiness and agony are just next to each otherbr br Btw Jim Sheridans works are all good IN America THE BOXER etc except GET RICH OR DIE Trying god knows why he chose to direct that crap Really a career taint for him what a pity,1

After the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi Yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show on the good episodes as darkplace i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really arent that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver Steve Pising pronounced Pissing and the great Garth Marengi to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as Dean Learner makes many inside jokes but even if you havent seen much Dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie His argument with Def Lepord over their name All in All a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes,1

I caught this on television one day when I was young and loved it In the 1970s there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise Its one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to Murrarys excellent comedic performance which still stands as one of his greatest This is the film that really got Ivan Reitman noticed as a director Reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that its fun MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely dreadful Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS,1
The films design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country US We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film Befittingly the obvious of student vs teacher is present But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male vs female white vs black and the individual vs society But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual vs himself br br I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides It did not attempt to show how either was right although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive quite obvious towards the end The film also discusses sex and rape It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together for a time Lawrence Fishburne does an overthetop performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and downtrodden with the industrious and positive Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can actbr br Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper In fact I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at a university It is a lifelearning process not a textual one I think youll find Higher Learning is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general 810,1
Lady and the tramp ii scamps adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better Lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original but this time its juniors turn Lady and Tramps youngster scamp always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him following the rules in the house taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose Scamp meets another dog called Angel they both get along fine and do the things scamps mother and father did having an italian meal Spagetthi and Meatballs etcAfterwards Scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal which is the baby scamp comes back and Angel is joined in the family I give this movie 10 out of 10,1

Yes it is a bit cheesy But its suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorites there are some excellent actors in the film and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters Its interesting to see David Soul in a bad guy role I thought he was quite believableand rather chillingas the evermoreparanoid CO Robert Conrad is a longtime favoriteI think he brings his character to life very well and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his Ive watchedmovies or TV br br I watch this movie every so often but our tape a VHS TV copy I got is such poor quality its difficult to fully enjoy it This is a movie I think they should put out on DVD maybe it wouldnt be universally sought after but Im sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there WOULD be a market for a DVD version Ill keep hoping,1

I absolutely loved this film I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful I remember how hard it was when John was shot However watching the Two of Us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which was so poignant The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which I feel are appropriate given the circumstances,1
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the films plot details than I could What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually editorially just gorgeousbr br If you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of artbr br On a scale of 1 to 10 Id give it about an 875 The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece If you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then its a 10 I definitely think its a mustsee but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 875,1
Have to agree that this movie and its talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve Heres hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors,1
This was my first Gaspar Noe movie Ive watched and I have to say I was shocked I dont mind gore in generally but this isnt even gore its real butchering For some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting Leaving aside these aspects the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given you cant stop and take a minute to think about it The actors did their job well representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society The movie is full of metaphors but Ill let you figure them out Dont watch it if you want to have a lite relaxing time I recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema,1
I agree with BigAlC this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993 Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here as always and the movie is greatly humorous and educational Im a big fan of Tom Sellecks and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part bringing the film to life in a way I cant imagine any other actor being able to pull off br br This film featured some firstrate Japanese actors and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with Selleck I can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie Japans an awesome place to go whether you want to party sightsee or just try to take everything in,1
I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role Gandolfini gives his typical A performance The entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays andor putting up with the relatives The best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped Namely the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree Go see it and have a good laugh,1
Although I lived in Australia in 1975 I moved overseas not long after fed up with constant industrial unrest the general worship of mediocrity unless one is a sportsman and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north br br Consequently I missed The Dismissal along with many other Australianmade TV dramas of the 80s and 90s such as the superb Janus and Phoenix series which I have since seen along with Wildsidebr br To me the filmed story of The Dismissal is fair and as far as I am aware accurate However as to public outrage it only shows one side of the picture not how families were riven by the controversy I know as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward br br But the commentary is in my view very onesided throughout The inescapable fact is that notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community the Australian electorate chose and chose decisively in favour of Fraser as they did again two years later br br This apart a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama,1

This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kongs New Wave that began with Tsui Harks ZU Warriors of Magic Mountain Tsui set a tone for the New Waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave Jackie Chan Sammo Hung Wong Jing Ching Siu Tung etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy Burning Paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeancebr br Its not that there isnt humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw But this is just as humans are not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the timebr br When irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before He is the very incarnation of Miltons Satan from Paradise Lost Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven And if he cant get to Satans hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into a living hell he can rulebr br Thats the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here Its not that the Abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality Thus theres a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the Abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in chargebr br Of course fortunately the film doesnt end there Though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails If you want to know how see the film Yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell Hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all,1

Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century Two beautiful and musically talented sisters giveup their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to lookafter their ageing father One day a French woman Babette comes to work for them After some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast which changes the lives of all those invited This is a film about human and cultural interaction reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from Danish to French and especially between the dutiful sobriety of Protestant northern Europe and the sensuousness of the Catholic south It is also about human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses A profoundly uplifting film,1

On watching this film I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity Karen Carpenter was a carefree but very unconfident young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs As with all celebrities of today they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks styles etc THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight which eventually caused her death This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching But on starting to view it then I was hooked In the same way that the Tina Turner story does then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life The acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made then the directional and the dialogue are still entertainingbr br I would recommend this to anyone who hasnt yet watched it It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged,1
Nothing is sacred Just ask Ernie Fosselius These days everybody has a video camera and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying quickly written and shot and often posted directly to the internet Spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers dont get off on their own selfimportance 25 years ago when the first Star Wars was made it was a different world Filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare Then God gave us Hardware Wars It was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact Does that take away from the experience HECK NO Thats what makes it so great It was raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber I did that when I was young to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster to Auggie Ben Doggies nah just a little headache remark this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual Star Wars films Rent it Buy it Borrow it from a friend And may the Farce be with you Always,1
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings The performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic An interesting exploration into family relationships and environments,1
Strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in Denmark so I had to wait for the video release My expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed As always with Ang Lee there is fantastic acting an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming Along with Unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90sbr br People who expect something along the line of Mel Gibson in The Patriotcorny or Braveheartacceptable will be sourly disappointed all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it 9 out of 10,1

I like cheap perfume better it doesnt last as long Ralph Meekers convict character Lawson tells this to Barbara Stanwycks Helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out wher husband in Tijuana This line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfumeloving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run I agree with some of the other comments posted about Helens attraction to Lawson Even though her narration states that she wants Lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldnt likely wash away with the tide,1

This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here This is still the best Action movie ever done The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan The stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing The end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt,1
I watch this movie without big expectations I think everyone should do Its a great Tvserie and of course we couldnt compare it with Gone With the wind but its still nice to watch Its also weird to see a different Scarlett Joanne Whalley dont play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh but I believe that Scarlett is changed when she became older Dont expect to much of this just watch but dont watch like I think this would be horrible,1
What a fun filled sexy movie They certainly dont make them like this anymore 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all sorts of sexual misadventures The tone is oddly innocent as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant Richard O Sullivan literally gets Randisic The film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school My special interest in Au Pair Girls is that I am a huge fan of Gabrielle Drake If any actress has ever looked better naked shes slim but wonderfully curvy or clothed come to that Ive loved her since the original run of UFO who else could carry off a purple wig Ill eat my hat,1

I remember the events of this movie the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968 in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race I was a 13 year old living in England The previous year Francis Chichester later Sir Francis he was knighted for his exploits had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return on a grainy black and white TV and then his knighting by the Queen It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK It all seems so quaint now Chichester became a national hero but he had stopped half way in Australia to refit his yacht so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stoppingbr br Its important to remember that this was a world preGPS when communications on land were still pretty erratic never mind in the middle of the ocean Now with GPS receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth its hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally vanish As Donald Crowhurst did br br A number of yachtsmen signed up all men back then including mystery man Crowhurst Essentially a weekend sailor Crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise including careers in the British Army the Air Force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids He wanted to do something big with his life and he saw the five thousand pound first prize well over 100000 in todays money and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business He signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat and which meant failure would bankrupt him and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race Now the Brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the pros Think Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competitions and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race The public queued up to see him set off but his boat wasnt really ready and even as he started the last competitor to leave the UK Crowhurst must have known he didnt seriously have a chance But too much was riding on him to quitbr br In the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wifes face Left behind with their 4 children she is interviewed movingly throughout the film together with one of Crowhursts sons She was in a nowin situation Had she attempted to stop him she would have been considered a spoiler but afterward she was riven with doubt as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him Faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans and unable to turn around and face ridicule bankruptcy and ignominy Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat Laid up offshore Argentina and Brazil out of radio contact he waited for the leaders to round Cape Horn and start back up the Atlantic thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe He elaborately falsified his logs and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan But as one after another the other competitors dropped out he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized Unable to face certain detection his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide His yacht was found He never was br br This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier an experienced and enigmatic French sailor who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize when he abruptly left the race unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face and sailed into the wide blue yonder eventually pulling up some 10 months later in Tahiti Having spent some seven years working at sea myself albeit on very different ships to these I well understand the pull of the ocean Standing on deck seeing water in every direction to the horizon knowing theres a couple of miles of water below you nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull without easy access to TV or radio even nowadays on most working ships you feel pretty isolated its possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while There is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind Most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea the search for self br br I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston the ex navy guy who won the race and many since probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route Those who went searching for something profound within themselves may not have entirely liked what they found br br The marvelous archive footage of Britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this did it really look quite that bad I dont remember it looking quite so dowdy but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past but overall it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie Highly recommended,1
Okay so I love Aidan Quinns acting even with a bad script This is not the case in The Assignment As other viewers have said this was a movie I stumbled upon on cable and got so into it I didnt want it to end Take one Cuban American Navy OfcQuinnwho is an upright uptight soldier and family man Add a crazed agentDonald Sutherland who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a Ben Kingsley and you have The Assignment Sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist Carlos actions in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breathbr br Take one soldier on a pass in Israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by Kingsley until they realize they have a plan By taking on Carlos by being him or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip By not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely So the training begins Lets say Carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts When I say this intense and wonderfully castedscripted and executed film rates the best I am not understating it All three actors could save almost any scripttogether this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits I am not into terrorism or movies about it but I got hooked Bravo again to Aidan Quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including Gary Oldman Thats a compliment Rent it and get lots of popcorn Oh did I mention the sex It works better than Last Tangoand its educational,1
I saw SEA OF DUST as part of a NYC screening audience several years ago I enjoyed the film at that time so I was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since Perhaps its my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival Im really not sure which version I prefer but I can honestly say that I found something to appreciate it bothbr br Let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie Although its been promoted as a Hammer Films tribute people expecting a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula are going to be sorely disappointed Theres some cleavage but no nudity a staple of the British production houses later movies And while SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features Hammer starlet Ingrid Pitt its not like any of the companys pictures in tone or execution This film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny I dont remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but thats not a bad thing especially the showdown in the Black Forest that plays like a Three Stooges short And some of Ms Pitts rantings are quite entertaining Its like somebody wound her up and turned her loosebr br The uniqueness of this film doesnt lie with the borrowed details though Its in the ideas As an occasional Sci Fi Channel viewer Ive regularly taken the network to task for its onenote variations on a theme CGI monster kills then gets destroyed SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a whilebr br But dont get me wrong Im not complaining If anything I applaud these guys for making such an enterprising lowbudget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts Its not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are But for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket,1
Having finally caught up with this masterpiece it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever in its day Its French arty underplayed to the point of agony and ultimately downbeat But viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future its also just a bit vacuous pretentious and unsatisfyingbr br Others have summarized the story but I dont think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film the lead characters Corey and Vogel really dont deserve what they get They play square within their code never harm anyone who didnt ask for it and show great courage and initiative Moreover Corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland friend who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed apparently just because he Corey dared to borrow a few thousand francs These are guys who really ought to be due for a break Instead things go far worse for them than they really need to within the logic of the storybr br One might contend that this is the whole point that the real villains never get caught that they collude with the police as needed sell out their friends and always come out on top But thats not shown either Coreys old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police Nor is he shown gloating over his victory In fact after materializing several times when hes needed hes nowhere to be seen at the conclusion leaving a dramatic tension his feud with Corey entirely unresolvedbr br Nonetheless Id say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography its slow deliberate pacing its great deadpan performances its elaborate heist sequence and its encapsulation of the artfilm style of the late 1960s,1
Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British I think DVDlabel specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies mostly Italian ones from the glorious eras when everything was possible namely from the late 60s up until the mid80s The labels selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of Mondo Macabro and No Shame they probably even borrowed the name of the latter and they already released some really rare sick Italian puppies like Ratman My Dear Killer Killer Nun Phantom of Death and Torso The Frightened Woman was completely unknown to me but since fellow reviewers from around here whose opinions I hugely value described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic eurosexploitation movies of its era I didnt hesitate to pick it up This is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 of the average cinemaloving audiences If youre part of that remaining 1 however youre in for a really unique treat The style atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Francos Succubus and Massimo Dallamanos Venus in Furs yet theyre both widely considered as classics whereas The Frightened Woman is virtually unknown Its all a matter of profiling and good marketing I guess The story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion owns multiple oldtimer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a lifesize mannequin doll replica of himself with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women He considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street Dr Sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit but he slowly falls for her Just he starts to believe in actual love she strikes back with a vengeance This really isnt for everyone but if you can appreciate moody sinisterly sexy ambiances bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal you can consider this one a top recommendation Its slow stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers Shameless Entertainment all right,1

At the height of the Celebrity Big Brother racism row in 2007 involving Shilpa Shetty and the late Jade Goody I condemned on an internet forum those CBB fans who praised the show after years of bashing racist 70s sitcoms such as Curry Chips Love Thy Neighbour I thought they were being hypocritical and said so It Aint Half Hot Mum was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an English actor blackedup Well yes but Michael Bates had lived in India as a boy and spoke Urdu fluently The shows detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer Rangi Ram The noted Indian character actor Renu Setna said in a 1995 documentary Perry Croft The Sitcoms that he was upset when he heard Bates had landed the role but added No Indian actor could have played that role as well as Bates Indeedbr br Mum was Perry and Crofts companion show to Dads Army also set in wartime the sedate English town of WalmingtonOnSea had been replaced by the hot steamy jungles of India in particularly a place called Deolali where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them Bombadier Solomons George Layton his first sitcom role since Doctor In Charge camp Gunner Gloria Beaumont Melvyn Hayes diminutive Gunner Lofty Sugden Lah dedah Gunner Graham John Clegg and Gunner Parkins the late Christopher Mitchell Presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose SergeantMajor Williams the brilliant Windsor Davies who regarded them all as poofs His frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying though he was nice to Parkins whom he thought was his illegitimate son Then there was everso English Colonel Reynolds Donald Hewlett and dimwitted Captain Ashwood Michael Knowles Rangi was like a wise old sage beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure Hindu proverbs He loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically British His friends were the teamaking Char Wallah the late Dino Shafeek who went on to Mind Your Language and the rope pulling Punka Wallah Babar Bhatti So real Indians featured in the show another point its detractors ignore Shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as vocal interruptions similar to the 40s songs used as incidental music on Dads Army Each edition closed with him warbling Land Of Hope Glory only to be silenced by a Shut Up from Williams The excellent opening theme was penned by Jimmy Perry and Derek Tavernerbr br Though never quite equalling Dads Army in the publics affections Mum nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons In 1975 Davies and Estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut Whispering Grass They then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts entitled what else Sing Loftybr br The show hit crisis point three years later when Bates died of cancer Rather than recast the role of Rangi the writers just let him be quietly forgotten When George Layton left the character of Gloria took his place as Bombadier providing another source of comedybr br The last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave India by boat for Blighty the Char Wallah watching them go with great sadness as did viewers br br Repeats have been few and far between mainly on UK Gold all because of its socalled dodgy reputation This is strange For one thing the show was not specifically about racism If a white man blackedup is so wrong why does David Leans 1984 film A Passage to India still get shown on television it featured Alec Guinness as an Indian and won two Oscars It was derived from Jimmy Perrys own experiences Some characters were based on real people the SergeantMajor really did refer to his men as poofs I take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right Sanitizing the past no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences is fundamentally dishonest Mum was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this Thank heavens for DVDs I say Time to stop this review As Williams would say Ill have no gossiping in this jungle,1
I am from Texas and live very close to Plano where the actual deaths occurred so I might be a bit biased in saying that Wasted is a film that you just cant get out of your headbr br Stahl Phoenix and Paul all play their characters very realistically You truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts The drug content is handled very graphically as well although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking I definitely recommend this film to anyone Once you watch it it sticks with you,1
Mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story Everyone probably has one and this is writerdirector Yasmin Ahmads story of hers with a boy called Mukhsin We know that her movies have been semiautobiographical of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty Mukhsin is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date though I must add as a personal bias that Sepet still has a special place in my heartbr br Our favourite family is back Pak Atan Mak Inom Orked and Kak Yam though this time we go back to when Orked is age 10 The characters are all younger from the movies weve journeyed with them from Rabun to Gubra and here Sharifah Amanis sisters Sharifah Aryana and Sharifah Aleya take on the roles of Orked and Mak Inom respectively which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen nevermind that their not playing sibling roles The only constant it seems is Kak Yam played by Adibah Noor and even Pak Atan has hair on his head Through Mukshin the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that Yasmin has introduced us to We come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more set in the days when theyre still living in their kampung revisited back in Rabun where Orked attends a Chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches and you wonder about that burst of energy in Gubra well she had it in her since young The perennial tomboy and doted child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless masakmasak with the girls and favourite outings include going with the family to football matchesbr br The arrival of a boy called Mukhsin Mohd Syafie Naswip to the village provides a cool peer for Orked to hang out and do stuff with cycling through the villages climbing trees flying kites And as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotionsbr br Mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood In short those scenes screamed fun We observe the life in a typical kampung where some neighbours are very nice while others the nosy parkers and rumour mongers spreading ill gossip stemming from envy There are 2 additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate neighbour and the other from Mukhsins own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to Orkeds ownbr br As always Yasmins movies are filled with excellent music and for Mukhsin it has something special the song Hujan as penned by her father as well as Ne Me Quitte Pas aptly used in the movie Given that the Yasmins movies to date have been centred around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and pieced together makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance love and forgiveness Fans will definitely see the many links in Mukhsin back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events like that pudgy boy who steals glances at Orkedbr br And speaking of whys parts of Mukhsin too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of Yasmins style or deliberately left as such I thought that as a story about childhood recollected from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure And subtly I felt that Mukhsin exhibited this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the twobr br Another highly recommended movie and a rare one that I feel is suitable for all ages bring along your kid brother or sister,1
The film is partly a thriller and partly a publicservice announcement when seeing the events through the perspectives of politicians terrorists and of course victims In this smart drama lessons are given about contamination and surviving chaos while meantime the backstage look at the way crisis is managed prompts viewers to distrust guardians and to be scared by assailants The film originally aired on BBC gets to arouse effectively doubts on official prepareparedness Performances are proper understated though never terrific The flick is just a beginning a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it gets to work in my opinion giving the right thrills and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself questions,1

Not the best plot in the world but the comedy in this movie rules Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman Lauren Holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as Lt Lake Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie playing probably the most serious character in the movie The actor i liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilariousbr br Plot is a little uneven about Lt Commander Tom Dodge who for years has wanted to Command his own sub When he finally gets the chance instead of a brand new sub he gets a rusty WWII Diesel Sub the Stingray His crew isnt any better misfits of the US Navy He is then put in a series of War Games that shows how an old Diesel Engine can handle itself against the current Nuclear Navy Things still dont get any better when he finds out his dive officer is actually a female officer to see how Women do on actual Subs To get the commander position he wants he has to win the War Games and blow up a Dummy Shipbr br The movie fairs quite well in fact i laughed nonstop when i saw this movie in theaters I loved when they were in silence and Buckman farts and everyones reaction to the smell is hilariousbr br Overall 9 out of 10 this movie is just plain fun to watch it nice to have a movie like this i hate movies that try to be 100 serious,1
What a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film This is the best work Busy Phillips has ever done and the best from Erika Christensen since Traffic This film certainly should be in Oscar contention See this movie,1
Felt it was very balanced in showing what Jehovahs Witnesses have done in protecting American freedoms It also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses I also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a Jehovahs Witness affects nonwitness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they dont celebrate holidays the sad part is that nonwitness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinnersvisits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays When it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained which would you prefer to treat your loved ones I highly recommend this video,1
A proof that its not necessary for a movie to have a deep manylayered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie Even if the story could be expanded in many directions especially in more sociological way people lust for money it seems that its perfect just the way it is Through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen br br But the acting for me isnt so good With the exception of Lindsey McKeon the others were average or even worst In some scenes they just emptystared in front of themselves For exception of Lindsey which was more convincing Its a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying br br 710,1
I also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it even though I have never seen it again anywhere br br I dont know whether if I did see it now it would seem dated but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films Ive seen on Zone Horror I should think it would stand up very wellbr br I can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming reanimated and the blue lightning Having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one it must be good,1

I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say isWhat did I just watch And I mean that in a good and bad waybr br The plot is really simple Stiller and Black play friendsneighbors Stiller is the focused hardworker while Black is a dreamer Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo The idea becomes very popular and Black becomes very rich The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envybr br As I said the plot is simple Everything else is plain odd The direction is odd with a weird rotating opening shot to outofnowhere sped up sequences The dialouge and the acting is very odd odd in a rambling sort of way And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie from the weird Envy song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think youre going to hear a classic 80s song but suddenly its in Japanesebr br So the true question is thisis odd funny That depends purely on the individual I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free Strangely I understood their point There are no jokes whatsoever so if you arent hooked by the uniqueness of it all you will hate this movie Absolutely hate itbr br This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic If you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love then I suggest you see it If you dont run away from this movie Itll only make you mad,1

In the colonies were not all that familiar with Arthur Askey so I nearly skipped this film which had its TCM preview recently on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in Ghost Train which I expected to be thoroughly annoying Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly The physical aspects of Askeys comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what youd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre One can feel moreover the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here As for the rest of the film the more movies youve seen the more likely youll guess at the ending but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance,1
In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding images of Abu Ghraib or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay Gavin Hoods Rendition is about as uptotheminute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood Its not by any stretch of the imagination a perfect film but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrumbr br The term rendition refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time all without due process of law Anwar ElIbrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States He has an American wife a young son and a new baby on the way He seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist yet one day without warning or explanation Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing aboutbr br On the negative side Rendition falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwars interrogation at the hands of Egyptian officials The problem is that as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal Freeman seems too much of a naïve boy scout to make for a very plausible agent and he isnt given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character We know little about him at the beginning and even less it seems at the end He goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within Thus without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams with story elements flying off in all directions A similar problem occurs with Anwars distraught wife played by Reese Witherspoon a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performancesbr br What makes Rendition an ultimately powerful film however is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movies closing stretches It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject but hey this is Hollywood after all and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted let alone see the light of day as a completed projectbr br Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogatortorturer Meryl Streep Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebebr br Does the movie oversimplify the issues Probably Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces Most definitely One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist Yet the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground It isnt afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hardwon principle of civil liberties for all in the face of terrorism and fear And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say enough is enough even at the risk of being branded terroristappeasing and unpatriotic by those in power The movie also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorismbr br Thus to reject Rendition out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good Rendition may not be perfect but it IS good and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live And that alone makes it very much worth seeing,1

My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator the extra on the film and his unhappy assessment of the film I think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director The film was sweet the acting sufficient the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week It wasnt The Hours acting or The Matrix Special Effects or even The Color Purple Direction Most movies wont be But it also wasnt the crap fest that vinny would lead you to believe Sorry guy just my 2 centsbr br As to the movie itself it was in the end very gay affirming 1 It showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect peopleyou know just like ours 2 It opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures 3 And I liked the music 4,1
i happen to love this show Its a refreshing take on some older scifi feels and styles they arent afraid to shoot and when they do people tend to die Far too many shows are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff Farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters They all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their boxs to make the miniseries From beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and dispair as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die surprising you every time Worth a watch even if you dont have the time,1
In KPAX Softley brushes on the subtleties of Eastern Religious Mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of Prot Spacey Prot assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in Buddhism and Hinduism It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm the world is in disarray and is bright and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees but Prot sees truth he sees the minute and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanlybr br The film is particularly detailed therefore I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley interjects nuances Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophiesbr br 9 of out 10 rating Superb with nominal room for improvement,1
I thought Rachel York was fantastic as Lucy I have seen her in Kiss Me Kate and VictorVictoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations She is a chameleon who can play and sing anythingbr br I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding Rachels performance in Lucy Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel doesnt really look like Lucy My response to that is So what I wasnt looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown And Rachel certainly gave us that in great depth I also didnt want to see someone simply doing classic Lucy routines Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory It seems that some of the reviewers didnt realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits This approach I thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart I also thought Rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated the Professor and the Grape Stomping in particular There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachels mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember Lucy having I couldnt believe she was able to capture that and so naturallybr br I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of I Love Lucy throughout the entire movie After all those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what Lucy was really like in her early movie years I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances Lucy didnt fit the mold of the old studio system In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate giftsbr br I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing Lucy was a star turn for Rachel York I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future I also hope it brings her an Emmy,1
I want Céline and Jessie go further in their relationship I want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached This is about love but not stupid things like in notting hills or those kind of movie This is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling This was so clever and touching I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there I want to go to Vienna I want to see them as soon as possible againbr br I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happenbr br Im french and didnt know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski three colors white Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect actingbr br i saw before sunset the sequel in Paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter They are both masterpieces proof that you dont need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings Im sorry for my English which i m trying to bestbr br Franck in France,1

Peak Practice was a British drama series about a GP surgery in Cardale a small fictional town in the Derbyshire Peak District and the doctors who worked there It ran on ITV from 1993 to 2002 and was one of their most successful series at the time It originally starred Kevin Whately as Dr Jack Kerruish Amanda Burton as Dr Beth Glover and Simon Shepherd as Dr Will Preston though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the seriesbr br The series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff Viewers wrote to ITV in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website Peak Practice Online However all pleas were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not make any more episodesbr br Peak Practice was replaced by Sweet Medicine another medical series set in Derbyshire It lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedulesbr br Cardale was based on the Derbyshire village of Crich and the series was filmed there and at other nearby Derbyshire towns and villages most notably Matlock and Ashover After the end of this programme ITV attempted to launch a followup series called Sweet Medicine which extended the stories of different characters from the original show,1
Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility She will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation And thus beneath the vicey exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with and then I woke up It is also bookended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence Ive ever seen but dont let any of that put you off,1
Gypsy is possibly the greatest musical ever written so its too bad that its film version was such a disappointment To make up for that we have this remake which if not flawless is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical The script is completely accurate all the songs included and the staging remains close to the original Jerome Robbins staging Bette Midler is a deft choice for Rose her singing and personality Mermanesquire and her acting splendid Peter Reigert is a fine Herby if not a great singer and Cynthia Gibb is a straight forward natural Louise In truth a live taping of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly might have been a better idea if only because Gypsy is simply more exciting on stage But this film is a fine translation of a great musical,1

This has been edited for spacebr br Chanwook Parks new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify Nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion and its analog of viral invasion of a body romance and few other things as well Its a film that has almost too much on its mind The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature in this case Emile Zolas Thérèse Raquin Its an odd mix that doesnt always gel but none the less has an incredible power Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center with a post film discussion by the director and I find my cage is increasingly rattled Its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospectbr br The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood its not explained he actually survives Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick Unfortunately all is not well The priest finds that he needs blood to survive He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family The priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend From there it all goes sidewaysbr br An ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was Its a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of waysbr br The film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the filmbr br The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life Its contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isnt going to work Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys rather its something else I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool The romance is also wonderfully handled Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but its the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special I love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation This is one of the great screen romances of all time It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust If youve ever loved deeply Im guessing youll find some part of your hear on screen I know I did The statement I just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it Its both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion The tragic romance will break your heart br br I wont lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great Its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing the whole doesnt always come together The various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other Frequently I was wondering where the film was going I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlesslybr br I liked the film a great deal I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it and Im guessing that it will do so for several days more Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year,1
I watch them allbr br Its not better than the amazing ones _Strictly Ballroom_ _Shall we dance_ Japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsbr br I am an English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting For example the name should scream dont watch How she move Since when can movie titles ignore grammar br br There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar Its just not Canadian standard English grammar Comments about the dialogue seem off to me I put on the subtitles because Im a Canadian standard English speaker so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it It wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so Americanbr br I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there I loved that the heroine was so atypically cast I enjoyed the stepping routines I liked the driven Mum character I felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesbr br In summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie,1

I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago Perhaps the long wait was worth it since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressivebr br In its outline this movie follows the timeworn script a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault the heist takes place a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all Even though the heist footage is transfixing it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film This film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller Relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on giving us two movies for the price of onebr br John Servais plays the idea man Tony le Stéphanois always referred to as le Stéphanois with such worldweariness that he could have just stepped out of a Camus novel Tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists reentering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his exlover who has taken up with another man where as punishment he physically whips her with a belt Thankfully that scene occurs off camera but you are not likely to forget it After that sobering event since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship Tony meets with two of his old partners in crime Jo and Mario and decides to join them in one last big heist They enlist the services of Cesar an Italian safe cracker played by director Dassin himself and we are off to the heistbr br The heist goes off without a hitch But Cesars womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned However we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir filmbr br It is established early on that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family in fact Jos son refers to him as uncle I think it is partly to help Jos family that Tony agrees to the heist The ending scenes where Tony saves the life of Jos kidnapped son partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions But only partially,1
I have not read the book that this was based uponinspired by This being some ofthe others are film roles the last work of John RitterRIP one hopes that it is hilarious And it is Almost every time hes present in this as a matter of fact Most of the cast supporting as well as regular play off each other well and the material tends to be great He plays Paul Hennessy the father of three teenagers Rory the typical guy of that age Kerry the depressive middlechild who fights for causes and awareness and Bridget the fashionloving popular ditz Sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sitcom and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy The show changed somewhat after Mr Threes Company passed on and for a while they couldnt seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs or being poignant and making sure to be respectful One can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that It could still be quite good some of the additions were fortunateif you like David Spade most of his part consists of him doing his schtick and had stuff to say My personal favorite episode is in the last season The humor is a nice mix of dumb person jokesmainly related to the highschoolers silliness dark comedy and crude material This dealt with sex and other adult topics but never in a graphic manner The language is mild and on occasion moderately strong I recommend this to any fan of those who made it 810,1
Brilliant thriller deserving far more fame Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their starring roles as is the entire supporting cast A truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding Based on a novel concerning homophobia this movie attacks postwar antiemitism and all intolerance and hatred with considerable power Though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences it still has the power to shock and works very well as a thriller in its own right A credit to all involved,1
I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it So charming and so very romantic David Duchovny and Ms Driver have chemistry that is so hot you will need to take off a layer of clothing The supporting cast is 100 top notch Just watching Caroll OConnor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen Like Jim Belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep FOREVER or him dancing in the kitchen This film made we wish I knew people like that in my own life Not to mention what woman does not want David Duchovny for a boyfriend,1
How nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together Josie Bissett and Rob Estes who are married in real life play a couple who marry in Las Vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households each has two boys and two girlsinto a cohesive family unit What transpires when the group which includes four teenagers two preteens and two younger children makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim The fights between the kids and one little love affair between two of them make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along More interesting than the Brady Bunch what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours Recommended as a feel good movie for all ages,1
I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel Jane Eyre Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane Ive seen other versions but none compare to this one The best one for me I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again The last time I saw this one was in 1984 when I was only 13 At that time I was a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Brontes novel I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episodes Id like to see it again because its so good,1
This review is for the extended cut of this moviebr br I first watched Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general ideabr br That being said Ive always found the storyline a bit confusing The movie is after all a love story And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scenebr br Well in the extended version this is no longer so The old original version begins off with a huge barrelclimbrugbylike sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version The opening sequence is DragonJackie Chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is aroundbr br Other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it The pacing is also better and overall it just works better It feels more like a love story and doesnt leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version doesbr br I suggest everyone who is a HongKong cinema or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intendedOr at least thats how I think it was intended Why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes When I was done watching it I felt like I had watched a completely new Jackie Chan movie although most of the sequences were the same,1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via Ebay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p I enjoyed the film the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a family saga rather than an action film The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time 1955 The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion In this film he was portrayed as being Jesus like in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites even through they were invading Egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power Initially one makes a connection between Sinuhe who was cast adrift in the river Nile in a reed basket and the Old Testament Moses But this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a Moses like character carries Akhenatons monotheistic religion out to the wider world if such a film will ever be politically possible to make It is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit the character played by Jean Simmons is hard to accept And that Sinuhe an educated physician would be so smitten by Nefer the Babylonian femme fatal to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and Tomb is not really believable neither that his parents would even have a tomb In real life Nefer Nefertitti was the wife of Akhenaton And although Horemheb did become Pharaoh it was after a few others including Tutankhamen who was the son of Akhenatonbr br But of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus Maybe following The De Vinci Code book and film this film be remade with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism I wait in great anticipation of such a film there are already numerous books on the subject,1
This is an hilarious movie One of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor From the largest role to the smallest each character is vivid unforgettable and so understandable It can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve,1
Amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70s and this from leading horror scribe Robert Bloch is one of their best efforts There are four stories all worthwhile but two Sweets For The Sweet and Method For Murder distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fearbr br In Sweets Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter Chloe Franks becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since Martin Stephens in The Innocents This installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring offscreen is a moment of purest horrorbr br Method of Murder is about a horror novelist Denholm Elliott who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy Dominic This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror Dominic may or may not be real so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations The brief shots of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly hauntingbr br The original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding Peter Cushings severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear,1
Lets start from this point This is not a movie intended for the common audience Utterly bizarre somehow incomprehensible totally unpredictable it just keep you stoned watching at the screen trying to figure out what will happen next If that by itself doesnt make you agree it is an excellent movie then go back to your family movies and forget about MOTORAMA It has material to be considered a cult movie it can be placed in the same category with movies that win awards in Cannes or other intellectual film festivals but sadly Hollywood already let if fall in oblivion simply because it is not commercial The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be Oscar material but he gives the right touch to the story Even the genre is difficult to describe it is not a comedy in the proper sense you dont know if you are supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which Gus gets involved It is more like an impossible adventure that some kids may wish to have but dont let them watch it either it is not a movie for kids So if you like Disney movies or are looking for a Home Alone style this one is definitively not for you But if you enjoy reading Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton then you will like Motorama So jump in your red Mustang get a tattoo spelling Tora and cruise Strangeland with Gus Id like that,1
My husband and I just got done watching this movie I was not expecting it to be this good I was really astonished at how great the story line was Im usually very good at figuring out twisty plotsbut this one had me I loved it Im going to have to watch it again before I take it back I might even have to buy it,1
Last year I fell in love with the Tim Burtons version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this one at the library Though I think Burtons is best probably because I like film a lot better than theater this is still a great production of the story I havent seen any of the other versions but I am trying to get my hands on thembr br After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd its hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role but George Hearn does a fantastic job Angela Lansbury is great as always and all of the singing is fantastic I found myself singing along This is a play you wont want to miss but try and see it before you see the film version so you wont have a biased view like me,1
I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me I say this because I know this independent film had a limited budgetresources but despite this it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of workbr br Enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which I cant help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come Eddie Monroe didnt fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing Its a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guardbr br Many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed and if this is true its a real tragedy since his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkablebr br Kudos to Fred Carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one,1
This is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesnt appear literally until half way in Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady Curtis though competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards perhaps he should have shaved his moustache and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe I found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex He is no stock villain Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr is again in top form as the little man with big ambitions His drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism This movie however is carried by the very capable and comely Ella Raines as the devoted would be lover of Henderson Carol Richmond She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall This is the first of her work I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent All in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to Recommended 810,1

I first saw Enchanted April about five years ago I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas Its about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April leaving their humdrum lives behind them They are very sad women at the outset of the film and you cant help but root them on as they plan this getaway with two other women they invite along to share the expenses This is perhaps the most feel good movie I have ever seen It pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths It was made with care and in very good taste You cannot help but smile all through it except when youre crying happy tears,1
Im a 53 yearold college professor I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter We all enjoyed the movie The film is original witty fastpaced and totally charming The plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow but twisty enough to keep an adult interested I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been They were functional but nothing stood out On the other hand makeup costume lighting cinematography editing and directing were excellent Altogether I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience I am disappointed that the professional critics almost all adult males savagely attacked the film Apparently they have something against films that portray strong intelligent and independent young women Their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film I recommend it strongly to every child and every parent,1
This show has to be my favorite out of all the 80s horror TV shows Like Tales from the Darkside also from the same creators this show is a rare gem If you agree with me PLEASE sign this petition I started to get the word out for Monsters and get it out on DVD Here is the petition address  Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim glim and Rain Dance I also loved the opening intro with the monster family That used to creep me out One of the things I would have to ask the DVD creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be I dont know if any of you remember that part but thats one of the main things that brings back memories to me I mean come on War of the Worlds the TV series already has been released on DVD so I say Monsters and also Tales from the Darkside and Friday the 13th the series should be released too We the fans need to speak our minds We need this awesome show on DVD so PLEASE spread the word,1
This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide The story is short if you ask me what is the story plot is simple a brother seeks for his lost sister Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna Yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70sHippie culture their submission to drugs freedom escaping duty family and adopting anything new such as eastern which was new for whites religion They have been handled perfectly Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable Songs are the best used unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs in this movie They have not been spoiledOne perfect example is Dekho o deewanoRam ka naam badnam na karo Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70s,1
As an aging rocker this movie mentions Heep and Quo my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline I just love this piece of creative genius I cannot recommend it more highly and Mick Jones added so much Foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever Lou Gramm I have watched this great work more than 10 times Bill Nighy what a voice and Jimmy Nail talent oozes from every pore then Astrid and Karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 1010 bloody brilliantbr br Alastair Perth Western Oz Originally from Windsor England,1
Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull Thank God with in a few years we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach High Noon or Shane but it gets an above average recommendation from mebr br,1
I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring Columbo to me After a few times I get bored and changed the channel I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others First Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Millands character He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair In return Culps character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career Out of anger Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere I dont know Maybe I just didnt care for this one at all Of course Columbo gets him in the end Its just the question of how,1
Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and theres a good reason for that because its not one of the bestbut as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser knownsmaller films The film does have some connection to blockbusters for a start its an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin the capable director behind a number of action films including Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prisons governor Naturally the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace and when the old execution room is reopened the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeancebr br The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base This is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesnt really have a plot to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting The horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but its never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in a decade of excess The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights As the film goes on we start to delve more into the backstory of the vengeful convicts ghost and while its fairly interesting some things about it dont make sense and it drags the film down a little Still everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down,1
Butch the peacemaker Evidently After the violent beginning with Spike Tom and Jerry all swinging away at each other Butch calls a halt and wants to know why Its a good questionbr br Cats can get along with dogs cant they he asks Tom who nods his head in agreement Mice can get along with cats right Jerry nods no and then sees that isnt the right answerbr br They go inside and Butch draws up a Peace Treaty complete with professional artwork Most of the rest and the bulk of the cartoon is the three of them being extremely nice to one another What a refreshing changeofpace I found it fun to watch I can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the headbr br Anyway you knew the peace wasnt going to last A big piece of steak spells the death of the peace treaty but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual Tom Jerry clever humor,1
I really wanted to write a title for this review that didnt come off as corny or gushing but still described my feelings for this show I can see now that it is not possible American Family is one of the best shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching on television Several reviewers here on IMDb have mentioned the word beautiful when describing this show Never has a word been more fitting The cinematography for this show is stunning Every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece The lighting camera moves scene composition and colorsI have to keep reminding myself that Im watching a TV Show and not a Motion Picture masterpiece The score by Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang brings tears to my eyes And most importantly the acting by the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere I do not feel like I am watching performancesI feel like Im watching real life If only real life could be this beautifulbr br American Family has indeed raised the bar for quality entertainment on Television I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it I could easily chide CBS for passing on this show but I have to say that it doesnt matter to me who airs it Im just glad its out there for everyone to see So I do thank PBS for not allowing this show to disappear into nothingnessbr br I have to give special recognition to the way each seasons finale ended The first one was pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tears I was waiting to see if season two would also end in a creative way and sure enough it did Again tearsbr br My thanks to all of those involved You really have made a special piece of art with this show and I sincerely mean that It is a shame that we only got two seasons but a miracle we got anything at all,1
I saw this film at a special screening At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie but I was wrong The movie is based on the Shakespeares book The Twelth Night This movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer Well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school On her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love lies and deception This movie is this years Mean Girls I think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie,1

De Palmas technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques though unfortunately as with many of the films written by De Palma himself the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale br br The story opens with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband She is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously nearand the whole thing is revealed to be Angies fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed She has a short scene with her son a dead ringer for Harry Potter which concludes with a joke that shell tell grandma that he is playing with his peter She then goes to her therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her therapist Michael Caine He refuses and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilledbr br Then begins a bravura 22minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film Among the many things De Palma gleaned from Hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling stories and in typical De Palma fashion he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill The problem for me is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the directors skill br br The sequence begins with Angie at an art museum She watches strangers all involved in sexual or family activities then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her De Palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about Angies attraction embarrassment retreating and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab all set to a wonderfully lush score by Pino Donaggio who also scored Carriebr br In the second part of the sequence Angie has slept with the guy and gets up to return to her husband Again De Palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered as Angie realizes that she doesnt have her panties that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is that she has probably contracted a venereal disease and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle Its all very admirable but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor then up again almost in real timebr br Spoilers from here on out When Angie reaches the seventh floor again she is killed by a big woman with blond hair The woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there There is a wonderful slowmotion sequence as Nancy reaches into the elevator Angie reaches up toward her and the killers blade is held poised to slash Nancys hands Then follow some electrifying shots as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror Its all good and by the time we have some dialogue again you think Woah that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative Or maybe you dont but I dobr br A younger Dennis Franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough New York detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him He Interviews Michael Caine making the outrageous implication though it passes as commonplace that Angie WANTED to be killed Angies son is there as well and he hooks up with Nancy and they set about to spy on Caines therapist and find out who the killer isbr br Once again there is a strong tie to a Hitchcock film in this case Psycho just as Obsession is a reworking of Vertigo You have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space in this case an elevator rather than a shower Then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill De Palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing br br It is very interesting but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around and that is my primary reservation about this film It is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of De Palmas greatest setpieces but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for De Palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with wholehearted affectionbr br Check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies Cinema de Merde cinemademerdecom,1
Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday It had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up Im glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level True you really cant expect too much from hearing the plot rundown but after reading some of the reviews for it I was ecstatic I mean what trash fan wouldnt want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his makeshift monster truck I went in expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more This was a horror comedy that actually worked The film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time Kudos to Michael Davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor Let me list just a few reasons why I love this movie so much First off is the story Its been done to death in so many other flicks A college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married He being the 25 year old virgin that he is hops in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive Hidden in the backseat of his station wagon is good buddy Harley Harley is the loudmouth former friend who laughs and talks just like Jack Black in High Fidelity You cant help but like the guy but if he was your friend in real life youd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handylaugh all you want but have you ever been hit with one to keep him in check So hes a little on the obnoxious side to say the least but you can tell that hes a loyal friend deep downAnyway theyre on the road and when they stop in a bar they aggravate the locals Now theyre being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck Thats it Yeah along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but Im too lazy and hungover to go into that right now so just watch the damn moviebr br Second thing I love was the humor This one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever Just how messed up is it Well I wont even go into the whole cat scene and as for the corpse burrito thing Ill leave that to your virgin eyes as well The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too Harley although a totally obnoxious fratboy type can really sling off the one liners Love the clogs by the way I need a new pairbr br The GORE This one pours it on heavy While the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy the last third is all about blood and guts If the movie hadnt kept such a light tone throughout it would have been a little disturbing but seeing how it was all played for laughs there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it If youre still in your seat by the time it comes youll probably see the humor in it too but seriously there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff There was a big plot turn that I DIDNT see coming and when the credits rolled I was completely satisfied I had gotten exactly what I came for and Im really glad that I bought it Much like Cabin Fever its going to get a lot of replaybr br The Look of the movie was outstanding There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and I loved the exaggerated colors Its obvious that Monster Man was done on a relatively low budget but much like Cabin Fever sorry I keep comparing the two it actually works in the movies favor Cabin Fever was an ode to the 70s greats this was the 80s answer to that So take that for what its worth No CGI here This is what we all needed Im not exactly sure why it didnt get a theatrical release because this is everything that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been Thank god for Lions Gate,1
I was very moved by the story and because I am going through something similar with my own parents I really connected It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate And then theres the mistakes they made and have to live with I loved Ellen Burstyns performance and who is Christine Horne Shes fantastic A real find There is probably the most erotic scene Ive ever seen in a film yet nothing was shown it was just so beautifully done Overall the look and feel of the film was stunning a real emotional journey Cole Hauser is very very good in this picture he humanizes a man spiraling downwards I liked the way the filmmaker approached this womans life never sentimental never too much just enough to hook us in but not enough to bog down,1

Well where do I startbr br As one of the other reviewers said you know youre in for a real treat when you see the opening shot minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelatorbr br I wont repeat Rubins excellent summary of the story What I would like to say though is that this film gripped me more than any film I can remember I sat openmouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through The camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of Tony Servillo draw you to the screen and wont let you look awaybr br Its Italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style This is a film with lots to say about luck loss and lovebr br Go and see it,1
Begotten is one of the most unique films Ive ever seen It is more to me a study of sound light and dark and movement than a real story The type of thing you see as a video instillation at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater Im not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature the beasts in cloaks the twisted and tortured body of her child Some things just defy interpretation,1
Although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute it holds a certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint I tend to believe it is the scriptwriter Grant Morris see Dead Dog who despite the warped plot line injected a fantastic slice of humour sorely missing in many of todays box office hits Definitely a must see for a Sunday afternoon laughfest Speaking as a true single girl and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly but did ignite a small flame of hope for a lovelife Not my lovelife so much as my slightly crazy neighbours lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her She may find someone,1
Darr is a great movie Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is Juhi Chawla Little does Juhi know in the film that Shahrukh has a MAJOR crush on her and is constantly stalking her I have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls Never in my life will I forget the line I love you KkkKiranbr br Its just too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi werent exactly together in the film But Juhi and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie Though Shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic I still think he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role No wonder he got an award for Darr in 94br br Juhi what can I say She looks especially amazing in this film Its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but Darr did give the public a wonderful image of herbr br As for the music it was excellent Especially Jaadu Teri Nazar one of my all time favorite songs I also thought Tu Mere Samne was quite nice alsobr br A must see for everyone Overall Darr deserves a 910,1
I love this movie The cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters Judith Ivey did so well portraying a weak fearful dependent who was passive aggressive in her complaining and selfinvolved character that it was a relief to see the characters metamorphosis Blythe Danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental Jewish mother devoted wife and loving sister Jonathon Silmerman Bob Dishy Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz performed their roles equally wellbr br If you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope you will love this movie,1
This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great Maybe this is because Gorris takes Nabokovs initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation The final consequence is a point of view over Luzhin which dignifies him more than the Nabokovs onebr br The only thing in the movie which I dont like is the influence of Valentinovs on Luzhins destiny I cant imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so great influence on novels argument,1
Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylised look at Hong Kongs triad gangs Called election because a new leader or chairman is elected by ancient traditions every two years Two candidates are up for the position and through ego bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least Expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory The Asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence Subtitled volume 1 I think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals Either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right,1
A SHIRLEY TEMPLE Short Subjectbr br It can get mighty rough at Buttermilk Petes Cafe when the local contingency of diaperclad WAR BABIES come in for their midday milk breakbr br This primitive little film a spoof of military movies provides a few chuckles but little else tiny tots talking tough can begin to pall in a short time Shirley Temple playing a duplicitous hipswinging French miss hasnt much to do in this precelebrity performance Highlight the real signs of toddler temper when a few of the infants unexpectedly get well truly soaked with milkbr br Often overlooked or neglected today the one and tworeel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel Economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios feature films,1
I liked this movie a lot It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends over such a tragedy Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot My only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things Other than that it was great,1
Its pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone If you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in Canadian history being made Too bad you would have been watching it alone Probably the reason you hate it no game Keys to the VIP is hilarious light and funny Guys are going to eat this show up My game is tight and I can hardly wait to get on this show The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked ass Ill be watching every week It makes me wonder why more great shows like this one arent being made Now its clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television,1
George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet killing a guard in the process Months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money One of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the Nazis Not happy at being taken the Nazi front man insists on getting his money back at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up The middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the New York public library between various parties however as people begin to die the library is locked down and more murders and perhaps some rare book larceny seem to be close to happening Complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a cast of solid supporting players If there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves The layers of theft forgery murder and war time intrigue this was 1942 are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time Still its an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs Until Denning shows up were down among some charming thieves whom we like perhaps even more than the hero but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending and they know it even if they fight it A good little film thats worth searching out,1
This movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story Ive had real life experiance with a boy like Radio At the football program in my town weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team This movie is really true and i can identify with it 100 A boy like Radio just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living Thats how Radio feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school This is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen My dad and I loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man,1
Who doesnt have unresolved issues with parents And which parents dont have unresolved issues with each otherbr br I know that sounds heavy But this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better Ive always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie I was enchanted from the very first scenebr br Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person And Peter Falks monologue about being a hardworking sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point Without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less interestingbr br Nicely done Paul and Peter,1
Good animation nice character design and a lighthearted story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu enjoyable to watchbr br After my first viewing I thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for a second watchbr br This is because it is done out of chronological order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didnt see before OR it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didnt notice before You may want to read the original novels not manga by Tanigawa Nagaru beforeafter seeing this The anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it showsbr br However there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referenced tobamboo w wishes attached shown in episode 14 Overall this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot reading the book improves upon it as well It is a nice break from the shounenjump anime that seem to be taking over,1
A film like Crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness ie the recent film Crash almost to shame Not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intoleranceisrotten more significantly although Id wager Crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with Crash Maybe its not really necessary to compare the two as Crossfire is in its core all deep into the filmnoir vein like its going out of style It was interesting actually to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower on purpose so that more could be spent on the actors and the schedule went through at a very brisk quick pace But then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting setups that it took a lot to do Just for a small scene like when Robert Mitchums Keeely first goes in for questioning under the Captain Robert Young the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite That there are many other lighting setups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell the bars silhouetted against them and see what I meanbr br But back to the substance part of the film its really a story that consists of a murder mystery but one that we as the audience dont take long to figure on the answer Its then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldnt be found in a common crime picture then as there are really no criminals for the most part in the film Theres a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the worthwhile message against antisemitism But Dmytryks direction of his topshelf cast along with a really terrific script by John Paxton fleshes out the characters least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it Mitchum helps that along even in scenes like between him and Young where its very much based in the situation of the storys moment ie a detail in the plot by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog It may already be there in the lines but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenesbr br Then theres also Robert Ryan who excels at Montgomery as a man who you know you dont like much at first just through his bs demeanor but youre not totally sure about either Then once it starts to come clearer ironically through a subjective viewpoint of the suspect Mitchell George Cooper at the apartment of the soontobedeceased Samuels his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blindway Its a good performance when also countered with Cooper who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility Its really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this however and while youre watching the film its more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes and in the sometimes stark overpowering camera moves on the actors so the message is in a way secondary Not that it isnt an important one especially for the time period coming right off of WW2 but years later its seeing the actors even the ones that dont get the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny the femme fatale of the picture if it couldve had time for one which it doesnt and William Phipps as Leroy the hick working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplaybr br Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too as for very long stretches we hear nothing and mostly when it does come up its incidental to the characters surroundings He couldve just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis most specifically the opening audiencegrabber into the film By sticking clear of that and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine memorable level My favorite scene would probably go to Finleys story about an Irish immigrant he tells to Leroy where all such elements come into place well It might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs and Id still throwdown Murder My Sweet as the directors masterpiece in this kind of picture but its assuredly higher in quality than something of the Blevel too,1
The club scenes in this film are extremely believable Tim Curry is in his most venal mode and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies maybe even three What more do you require from an evenings entertainment Pump up the volume,1
15 Park Avenue well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata However as the story unfolds one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own 15 Park Avenue Its an unending search within each of one of usbr br The powerhouse performance from Shabana Azmi is a treat to watch Her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene Indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because I expected it to be all the way Konkona Sens terrain Shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life She burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister who is more like a daughter to her and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman As for the leading actress from Guide thats how I can recall her instantly there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there Ever dependable Rahul Bose plays another pivotal role in the film he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection This man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr Mrs Iyer and so many others He is one versatile I really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well The cameo in the movie is by Shefali Shah remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding She looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease She gives you a glimpse of todays Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husbands prior relationships br br The focus of camera has been Meethi portrayed by Konkona She and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 Park Avenue She has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience The fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful br br The movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in todays modern India and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family And I believe Aparna has succeeded to certain extent The helplessness of Meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of br br Well after I finished 15 Park Avenue there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me I wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally It has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups Must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema something with a strong purpose,1
Lion King 1 12 is a very fun and addictive sequel Dont expect the production values of a theatrical release but do expect the highest quality of direct to video releasebr br It is set up as Timon Pumba begin watching the original Lion King in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story This is done with frequent comedic interruptions For example during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined Pumba realizes he has sat on the remote These little moments pepper the movie and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor If you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie than this may not be your cup of teabr br Animation is the best theyve invested in the Disney DTV line and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material The newer independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original The voice talents are all well performed though I couldnt help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavnerbr br Many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitivebr br The music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a Disney feature The toetapping opening feature of Dig A Tunnel is well choreographed and hilarious Timon and Pumbas take on the Lion Kings opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing The only problem was the reprise of the Dig A Tunnel at the end of the movie switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to upliftingbr br Story line is pretty well done and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little The new story doesnt seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well and does better when it is resorting to full comedy br br Overall worth purchasing If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2disc set then go for it For the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away br br Damion Crowley,1
I was so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated I understand why some of you dislike this movie Its pace is slow a characteristic of Japanese films Nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not a problem at allbr br I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen Shall We Dansu is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies It is very different from Hollywood ones eg Austin Powers or Scary Movies in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes Rather it is lighthearted a movie that makes you feel goodbr br I love the movie because it makes me feel real The plot is straightforward yet pleasing I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork I felt lost However this film made me think of the bright side of life I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama if he could find himself in his hobby why couldnt I It reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily lifebr br It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes onbr br Over all this film is encouraging and heartwarming As a comedy it does its job perfectly It definitely deserves 10 starsbr br And yes Aoki is funny D,1
Ive tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 The reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review although a few have done that quite nicely already This film is confusing depressing and doesnt have a happy ending I still gave Pola X a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking Ive only seen two of Caraxs films this one and Mauvis Sang As with this film Im being somewhat pretentious when I call this one of Caraxs best films but I am Carax has a minimalist style If that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring then it would be best not to watch this But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller at least for my taste I found it quite interesting and absorbing The two lead roles did an excellent job acting I mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister Catherine D is always great but her role was not very large or significant in the story But everyone did a fine job I thought the cult stuff was great It may have not been very believable but that is due to its being rather abstract There is a lot going on between the lines in this film This is a very Freudian psychothriller,1

This is an excellent movie and I wish that they would put it out on DVD for people to purchase It is difficult to try to catch it on TV all the time As you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it Can someone tell me what file company make it so I can write to them and see if they will release it to the public I only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and I only got to see it once last year My sisters and I are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great They put out some much older movies and I think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and I think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on DVD,1
putting aside the im so sures and totally gnarlys this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romances portrayed on film deborah foreman where is she now as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeo and juliet tony and maria jake and samantha you cant help but fall in love with them plus the soundtrack the plimsouls sparks the furs the flirts and of course modern english is also outstanding for fans of films about young love id equally recommend the recent film all the real girls by david gordon green,1
A film that is so much a 30s Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the objectbr br Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at Warners a studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatresbr br Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island there is the generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been torn from the headlines Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that Theyre not the trophies gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that Warners were targeting in the great depression ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent Curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editingbr br Thank heavens there is no soppy love interest subplot so the fun can just keep rolling along,1
This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites Also number three of Joss personal favorites as well The episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the Emmys decided it merited a nomination Unfortunately it didnt win When Hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers which was the highest rated episode of season four That should tell you something Even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in Those gentlemen characters who were played my mimes were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced or any network TV show Ive seen Nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away I think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode,1
I think this movie was made as good as it could have been With only 4 months and a 52000 budget Im surprised this wasnt worse If you are not to care about the CG or special effects this movie is greatbr br Okay the movie is not that well made Im sure it could have been but you try to do better in only 4 months but the story is good and the movie is rather excitingbr br DOnt trust me when I say that this movie is good cause I also find the 1933 King Kong to be goodbr br I must confess that I didnt watch the complete movie either I might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there,1
One of my all time favourite films ever Just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence The story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many waysbr br The cast are also fantasic a great selection of the finest British talent around I loved them all for every diverse element brought into the filmbr br Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this everything about this film worksbr br I love it,1
being a high school studenti have to take a health class this year the topic is drugs we learn about the harm they can cause a person from what we talk about i still believe and know that drugs can really mess a person up anyway my teacher wanted us to watch this naturally we groan and start to sleep but like the rest of my class i actually did enjoy this movie it was totally real and not sugar coated at all the characters were amazing and believable even the plot was outstandingly realistic and believable what i liked about this movie mainly was how it got the point of the effects drugs can take on an abuser and the consequences the person has to deal with everyone reassures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them well lets get serious anything can happen in a small town even to your best friend like Sam and Chris this movie shows it a person can really learn a lot from watching this it was pretty effective,1
This movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself Oh I want to learn more about Custers life and his last stand do not rent They Died with Their Boots On But if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watchbr br The story starts out with Custers Errol Flynn first day at West Point Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battles including his battle in the Civil War The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn In between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with Libby Olivia De Havillandbr br Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant but suave George Armstrong Custer well Olivia De Havilland plays the cute sweet Libby very well especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance The acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel Her character will definitely make you laughbr br The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era The script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch The directors portrayal of Custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero Others will watch this movie and learn hate himbr br I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film,1
Müllers Büro is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end while others will stop watching it within five minutes It is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles Batmans Gotham City look carefully at the streets buildings the police car chasing the criminals etc It is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as Müllers secretary and Vitaseks the actor playing Müllers assistant lover who do their best to sing albeit not very successfullybr br The spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent Blue Box there is a real club with this name in Vienna where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background Müllers apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen Müllers bureau with the sweet picture of his assistant etcbr br The humorous moments in the movie are many and include flat in the face type of humor such as Müller farting in his assistants face the prostitute charging Müller extra for orgasm the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of Montana etcbr br A legendary film from the 80s especially for those interested in Austrian or Germanspeaking cinema,1
Peter Sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York or Loisaida as its known by the localsbr br Mr Solletts heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family that is typical of the different inner cities of the country Mr Sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents These are basically good kids the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing br br Instead of presenting his characters as losers Mr Sollett shows a positive side they all have These kids are not into drugs or are stealing because they are poor Had this story been done by Hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of children that are struggling but deep down inside they are not defeatedbr br Victor Rasuk as Victor Vargas was a revelation He is a natural So is July Marte Her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesnt want to do Altagracia Guzman as the grandmother is excellent She conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her br br All in all this was an excellent picture thanks to Peter Sollett,1
Ive seen this movie twice both times on Cinemax The first time in its unrated version which is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way The unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with Nikki Fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended Unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes Rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars Stallone Sheen Travolta etc trying to act We also get appearances by Bqueen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward Robin from the old Batman series,1
I have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes I still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the storytelling I am still a fanwith some minor painsbr br Though this installment into the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series hada stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everythingsound familiar I have to say that this one gets a bit too mellowdramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to bellyache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plansespecially the character called WufeiI mean he whines more than an American character on a soap opera Get a counselorwill yabr br Besides for the overexaggerated dramaI think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the English voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again I mean it can always be worse It could be like the recent installment SEEDeeee talk about mellowdramaticIll chat about that one later,1
Although the premise of the movie involves a major coincidence the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life I found myself rooting for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti empathizing with both and wanting them to reconcile Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are fine in their roles as well doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship While the story tends to leap through time occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail it still flows and avoids any real confusion This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good chick flick,1
I saw this movie and the play and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing This simply surpass a five star I rate it a ten Thank You Mr Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told it is still one that lays heavy in my heartIf there is a VHS or DVD out there on the play Please notify me ASAPThank You PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance,1

Beautiful film pure Cassavetes style Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging lonelinessand alcoholism She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl Acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling its like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin If all american movies could only be that topquality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings One of the best dramas ever 1010,1

All right heres the deal if youre easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one There are some painfully funny moments in the movie but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed Actually I probably blushed MORE than I laughed And if I wasnt literally blushing on the outside then I was blushing on the inside If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame Whether thats a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I supposebr br I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter If I were to say This movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old churchgoing lady heads to the theater and has a heartattack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well thats just something I dont need on my consciencebr br So how raunchy is it Hmm try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers Honestly My mom wouldve walked out during the first scene I feel its my duty to at least warn you of what to expectbr br There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but thats what I come to expect from the man Judd Apatow who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared Im all for making fun of Michael McDonald the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money Paul Rudd proclaiming If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time Ill Ya Mo burn this place down is hilarious but its one of those things that the majority of the audience wont appreciatebr br And when we see a quick 3second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameos Word Up I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about itbr br Strangely enough despite the raunch theres an admirable moral to the story The movie doesnt portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because hes a virgin Hes really portrayed as a likable admirable character Sure hes a little weird After all he has a framed Asia poster more videogames than an Asian kid and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Mans BOSS but were never led to believe that theres actually anything wrong with the fact that hes a virgin As odd as it may seem theres a bit of an its OK to wait messagebr br But man oh man please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go That was certainly Apatows intention According to him he just let some of the guys particularly Rogen and Malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty If you can handle that or talk that way yourself then youll love the moviebr br Im not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes I find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the fword or fratboy sex discussions But thats me Like I said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if theyre worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies youre likely to ever see at the theater I just dont know how interested most women will be in whats discussed by men while playing poker Honestly ladies you might not want to know If youve ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good ideabr br There you go my humble honest take on what to expect Be that your guide It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion If youd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable,1
Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system A semisurreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture or the lack of it focusing on some seriously wacked waybeyondtheHollywoodfringe dwellers It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies There was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart This film had cult classic written all over it and Im surprised its not yet out on DVD br br Hopefully soon,1
I love this film it is excellent and so funny Ben is FIT and i wouldnt mind meeting him on holiday I rate this film a 10 because its gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same Funny bit is wen Andre is looking at the moonand he shouts at Nicole to come outside and look at the moon that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old Another thing is Nicole looks a lot older then 14 but shes a gr8 actress But i need help with something Does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen Nicole and Andre are dancing Its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song,1
Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic The Stars Julie Andrews Rock Hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried Its full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you The brilliance of the Director Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best He was truly capturing the woman he loved on screenbr br The blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film The Film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same Song by Andrewsbr br For A Film Of This Excellence To Have Been Such A Failure When It Was Released Is A Total Shockbr br As It Is InspirationalPurelyInspirational One Of Andrews Most Memorable Lines In This Film,1
The sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore Sort of a soul version of the more wellknown The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of reuniting the members of a classic soul group and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque Derrick OConnor and Antonio Fargas Not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold,1
Ghillie a remake of the Telugu okkadu is thankfully a clarified version of the original It packs the same punch and Dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache A flagging Vijays career with the entry of the likes of Surya and Vikram on the fray got the much needed uplift with this movie This might well prove to be the best movie Vijay has ever been on considering the choices he has been making since then The hardworking actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alikebr br The tightly snug script which runs at a neckbreak speed revolves around Velu a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi a popular game among boys in India The events following the chance encounter with Muthupandi his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie Vijay fits as a T into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next doorbr br Trisha has more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine mantle to play The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble With limited dialogs Trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role This is a classic case of a cover page girl comingofage to become a professional actress Trisha became my personal favorite after this moviebr br The movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including Trishas change in decision to leave the country Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counterweight for Vijays role His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the heros armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessingbr br Overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing I give it a clear 8 out of 10,1
A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie Its based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film Really made you think about how youd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family memberin other words EVERYONEbr br Though the production isnt quite Hollywood qualityno big special effectsstill the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it And the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes illbr br You dont want to miss this,1

please future writers producers directors learn from this moviebr br never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen bold because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided a step to something new creative and daring just when you think oh ive seen this before or i am sure this is what will happen now StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the storybr br the actors are great even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie Robert De Niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene hes in Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch and Claire Danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving star Yvaine Other big names make outstanding roles I had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie But once again the story by Neil Gaiman all the little things he invented for this universe simply outstandingbr br I watched this movie at a prescreening today a day before the official release and do hope it will have huge success There is so much humor but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes The look in the eyes of Yvaine the frivolities of Captain Shakespeare the passion of Lamia the witch impressive unforgettablebr br For me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 watch it and enjoy itbr br 1110 Outstandingbr br peace and love,1
Once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists work has been fully restored and we see this oldtime grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling Inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etcbr br In essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettesbr br The whole show is narrated by Jack Bunny a Jack Benny impersonator with music from conductor Leopold Stokowski who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts I have lost count A lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who Little Egypt and other characters The Busby Berkeleytype aqua number with bathing suitedsardines coming out of the can and the tomato cancan dance were both clever br br All of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longerthannormal length cartoon The second half was about a King Kongtype which escapes from the Animal Crackers box and terrorizes everyone That part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note So an A for the first half a D for the second making it about a Cplus or Bminus overall,1
Henry Fool surprised me I didnt expect it to entertain and amuse as well or as strongly as it did Fay Grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to a story that seems not to need it Once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie however it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the BEST sequels to brilliant indie film At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back if not betterbr br I am a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblums part is so small but Im happy he is a part of this short run He is convincing and delightful as Agent Fulbright Also a delight is Liam Aiken who quite aptly portrays Ned Grim the son of Fay and Henrybr br This movie is a pleasure for so many reasons I am pleased for example to discover that Henry isnt really the loser he seems by the end of Fool and to further discover that he is in fact a geniuswell that really is a lovely stroke of the penbr br I am hoping they do a thirdlike the end of the trilogy It seems to be missing They should entitle it Ned Fool Grim and it should be Liam looking for his father to validate the awesome change in his mother and the sense of neargenius he himself feels welling inside him Assuming of course that Fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father It feels like it needs to be done Id buy itbr br Even with more action this is still not an action flick It is more drama and intriguea mystery of sorts Ill watch it oftenbr br It rates an 8310 frombr br the Fiend,1
at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this that shots of fat people sunbathing etc were cheap shots in a way OK so hes doing diane arbus meets whatever but it wasnt long before I realized that this wasnt being done in a dehumanizing way as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audiences we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly something that ought not to be shown if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal however the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks very eloquent storytelling incredible performances and to think the scene was improvised that blonde guy is a genius actor finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold so dont oversimplify the film by overlooking him yes his dog gets killed this aint a rosy picture of the world but its not completely hopeless anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all I wouldnt say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it,1
One of my absolute favorite childhood films The Chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike The animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature Who could forget the dynamic BoysGirls of Rock n Roll the exciting Diamond Dolls and the heartrending My Mother br br This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties Its too bad they dont make them like this anymore Most animated films today resort to violence crude humor or sentimental mush except of course the folks from Pixarbr br BOTTOM LINE An amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages,1

A lot of people give this movie a lot of crap and all of its really undeserved People give this movie a hard time either because its such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it If just by looking at the cover you think this movie will make you uncomfortableDONT WATCH IT However youd be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990s despite what anyone else saysbr br Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go The acting here is wonderful The film itself beautifully shot The subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow but its still well worth your time If you havent seen this movie check it out,1
Cedric Klapischs movie LAUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is easy breezy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger years and attractive youths At its core its the featurelength presentation of the longrunning MTV reality soap opera known as The Real World in which as its motto goes This is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real This is exactly what happens minus the cameras planted at every minuscule corner of the house in Barcelona Spain where Xavier Romain Duris comes to stay having to learn Spanish to fill into his jobs requirements An outsider in many ways he slowly forms a camaraderie with his housemates who come from all corners of Europe except America this is a movie in which the only American shown is an unlikable character with whom Wendy the adorable Kelly Reilly is having an affair with Only for sex she confesses since she has her own boyfriend who makes a late but dazed appearance Throughout his stay there he tries to maintain a longdistance relationship with his girlfriend played by Audrey Tautou while he begins a tentative flirtation with the wife of the owner of the Spanish house where he is staying at and gets some advice from a lesbian housemate Cecile de France as to how to seduce a woman A sweet little feature that presents a moment in time that twentysomethings will never see again LAUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is forgettable fun containing within itself the threshold into the real world experienced through Xaviers eyes,1
Hitchcock would be proud of this movie Even when nothing happens it is suspenseful Director David Lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtusebr br Altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts And yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme the mood the character development and the filming techniquesbr br The dual roles of the main actress Naomi Watts showcase her enormous talent That is when I could get my eyes off of her costar What an acting pairbr br Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles the lengthtiming of editing cuts jumping back and forth between scenes Combined with smart use of music and sounds it all helps to build suspense in our minds doubtless a major objective of the director Well he kept me on the edge of my seat even had me talking to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there You know the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies,1
Plots With A View of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the British could do it The films sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstickish Its the only film by director Nick Hurran Ive seen so far and while I am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment Im not a big fan of romantic comedies this one is highly enjoyable and very funny The film takes place in a little town in Wales where Betty RhysJones Brenda Blethyn is married to the towns drunken and adulterous major Robert Pugh The local mortician Boris Alfred Molina has been desperately in love with Betty since their childhood but has always been too shy to confess his love to her Apart from being desperately in love Boris has some other problems as the eccentric American mortician Frank Featherbed Christopher Walken has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town The films odd very British wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre Also Plots With A View profits from a wonderful cast Brenda Bethlyn who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000s Saving Grace plays the lead and she is once again very funny and very lovable in her role Alfred Molina who plays her shy admirer delivers a great performance as always and Robert Pugh fits perfectly in the role of Bettys sleazy husband Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the husbands secretary Im becoming a bigger fan with every film I see her in The greatest role however is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken one of my favorite actors Walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric Mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox Overall Plots With A View is a vastly entertaining little British Comedy that I highly recommend,1
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday since it originally played on USA networks Does Anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again I dont think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the Stepford wives and Stepford husband movies No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version Maybe they should also do a remake of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thrillerhorror flicks Well if anyone has any input Please I Beg Of You write me with information Thanks Taira tcampo23aolcom,1

Since there have been so many reviews of this fine film I will write in a list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussedbr br 1 Dana Andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie His character according to the screenplay was in his mid 20s Andrews a highly underrated actor did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger br br 2 Fredric March like all GREAT actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid overthetop acting He was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror br br 3 Dana Andrews was superb as he was in Laura The OxBowl Incident A Walk in the Sun The Purple Heart and many other films Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why was Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance br br 4 Harold Russell gave the best performance I have ever seen by a non actor br br 5 I realize this was the 1940s but Dana Andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife Virginia Mayobr br 6 Ray Teal who played the right wing bigot years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on Bonanzabr br 7 The professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving boring and poorly acted The professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films The beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity excessive violence and gratuitous sexbr br I was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful,1
OK this doesnt compare to the explosive tempo of the first parts opening sequence nor to its visual shock value nor for that matter to the melancholic suspense of the second installment No its surprisingly and refreshingly different apart of course from the two main actors The tongueincheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force The moment of impactconclusion is your choice of aShakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume bsublimation of violence into homoerotics chumorous detonation of an impossible buildup Everything up to then is even less unequivocalbr br Highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who dont mind following foie gras with a hot dog caution to those with more refined palates,1
This movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience I think that a lot of people get caught up in Lelands apparent mental illness as the storyline but I was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions Much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad which is a little cliché but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have whether you see the bad everywhere like Leland or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isnt going to work no matter how bad you want it to This movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie Ive seen and it is as depressing a movie as it is good,1
The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene the twist In those scenes there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty the way slashers should be edge to it The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore,1
I feel as though I know these people and have known people similar to them These days though people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness It has a slow beginning but then look out If you love romantic comedies but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change or at least did have back in the 70s then you should see this movie,1
Like a twisty country road Tough Luck takes the viewer for a ride There is nothing wrong with plot curves as long as believability doesnt fly out the window Unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audiences belief tolerance Nevertheless it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere Do not expect to like any of the characters Armand Asante Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play shady conartists not exactly the type of person easily admired The double crosses come fast and furious and the final cross is a bit of a stretch Recommended MERK,1
Has aged really well still thrilling and suspenseful today Certainly one of Hitchs best movies Beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sexappeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman Because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as the Master of Suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5,1
This is one of the best movies It is one of my favorites A movie with good acting The story is very sensitive and touching Good camera work alsobr br The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list However they give equal or better performances than the top of the listbr br It is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kickbox their way to save the worldbr br If you dont like this movie then you have no heart or feelings Then go watch a sports movie There is no killing or horror here See the movie It is a must TH,1
Bell Book and Candle was shown recently on cable Not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy Based on the James Van Drutens Broadway hit which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash The film was directed by Richard Quine who turned the play into a delightful comedybr br Evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on Vertigo released the same year Movie audiences didnt think anything about the age difference when this film was released In fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger womenbr br The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as its clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing As the witch that becomes human her Gillian is charming James Stewart who plays the publisher Shep Henderson is also seen at his best Mr Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the topbr br In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester playing Queenie is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here Jack Lemmons Nicky Holroyd the brother of Gillian is also good Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitchbr br This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching Bell Book and Candle,1
It is very hard to come up with new information about JFK Jr and this fine movie had very little of it but it was a joy to watch The casting was very good and the script while somewhat like a documentary was also good My only complaint was that it wasnt long enough Perhaps a twopart movie could have told us more about his preGeorge days and his relationships with his mother sister and other relatives Some of the material in the book American Son by Richard Blow would have enhanced the movie a lot WTBS should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie,1
This entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie Ive ever seen Perfect beautiful funny simply wonderfulbr br I found this movie delightful even with its French takingitselftooseriously deep meanings thing going on I loved it its a great love story And I loved the way Algerians were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great I want the CD,1
Halloween 666 1995 The producers cut reviewbr br Halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five If you thought the last chapter was dark this one will really blow your mind A mysterious Man in Black has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists What they want with her Who knows but lets just say her long suffering will end soon Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocents good luck A friend of Loomis Doctor Wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor Another old face from part one guest stars as wellbr br This dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing For some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasnt worth the average horror film watchers time So they decide to dumb it down Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office No matter what they did to the film they made it worse They should have left well enough alone Hey the film company knows better than the filmmakers nowdont theybr br Producers Cut Highly recommended br br Released version Not recommended,1
Definitely a must see for all fans of film noirbr br Thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thrillerbr br Wonderful characterizations articulate the movies powerful message of racial and religious tolerance Its difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isnt a weak link in the entire company but Robert Ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chillingbr br Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage Nowall these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and deafening soundtracks its refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like Crossfirebr br Another low budget gem from the Hollywood archives,1
If you are a traveller if there is a fire burning into your heart if youd call home every place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there see this movie and youll find out a little but wonderful piece of life sitting next to you,1
Matthau and Lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great The Dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where Lemmons character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time I see it Anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone I just love it And the fact the Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion These two great guys made a string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt,1
This is an incredible film I cant remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie this layered Its funny its tragic its compelling and most of all its a slice of Swedish small town life It crushes the clichés and dwells deeper It makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the charactersbr br Big city girl tracing back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday crossing paths with people she hasnt met in several years Although the story itself isnt unique it offers a fresh approach The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who arent very close Or at least dont realize how close they arebr br One key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast First Im more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no socalled Alist Swedish actors in this film Usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in Sweden This time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to prove that you dont need words to convey an emotionbr br The writing is also very appealing The dialogue is more than believable and compared with other Swedish films from the past year or two its ahead by miles Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning and if you didnt know you would never guess that this is her first time writing AND directing a feature length film I cant wait for her next onebr br Once you start watching this you really want to see it through,1
Though not Hal Hartleys best work my personal favorite is Surviving Desire there is still much to like about this movie especially for fans of Hartleys dialogues Even to audiences new to Hartley I would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric Dogma This movie is more intelligent truer to its source material the Bible and more fun than any of the other premillennium apocalypse moviesbr br This movie is actually part of the French 2000 As Seen By 2000 Par Vu series as such it is perhaps even a lowerbudget film than Hartleys other works While the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurryjittery effect Id be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again especially at the beginning it almost makes the movie unwatchable But overlook this flaw and youll be treated to a fine film Especially notable is Magdalena played by PJ Harvey relating how Jesus saved her from being stoned to death a short scene I found surprisingly moving Despite the fact that it was NOT Mary Magdalene that this happened to the woman in the Bible was unnamedbr br,1
There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6 1957 at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching which showed the Vangard launch attempt which failedbr br He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr Von Braun offering condolences about the failurebr br Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight centerbr br The army rushed the JupiterC which was essentially a US made V2 technology but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russias success with Sputnikbr br This error may have actually been made by Homer because of the notoriety of Von Braun but his team didnt have their attempt fail In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster used for Shepards sub orbital flight as well as Grissomsbr br This is why this sort of movie is so good as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia and in the process see what has been done and be inspired to do more,1
I enjoyed this movie very much Kristy Swanson Omar epps and Ice Cube were all great in it The movie dealt with many issues and I didnt know if I was going to like it but Singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about,1
52Pick Up never got the respect it should have It works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot The actors involved give some of their finest performances AnnMargret Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals Notable too are Vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and Kelly Preston whos character will haunt you for a few days Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this,1
As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves we perhaps shouldnt expect too much from Broken in disc form And yet whats most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentationbr br With regards to the latter the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a nonanamorphic transfer Otherwise we get the film in its original 1851 ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected Indeed given Ferraris hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a factbr br The same is also true of the soundtrack Here we are offered both DD20 and DD51 mixes and whilst Im uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior Indeed though the DD51 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score both are equally fine and free of technical flawsbr br As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and youll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries Indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss The Anatomy of a Stunt featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Brokens preproduction production and postproduction And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall making of in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to viewbr br Of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion Then again theres also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks The one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesnt take the film too seriously Ferraris pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing And the technical ones are well extremely technical Of course we also get some crossover with whats been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome Indeed all in all a fine extras package,1
Child Sexploitation is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience After having seen both Trade and Holly one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide br br I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I must commend the makes of Holly for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure Trade wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking br br For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something I would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of Holly,1
i am surprised so few have good words for this movie For its time the 80s it was a very entertaining and engaging story Casting was good Story was good Special effects were remarkable for the time period Deserving of an 810,1
Seeing this film or rather set of films in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience This monumental exploration of individuals and their historical setting reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is The people are portrayed as they are to themselves their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception Edgar Reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longingsbr br When these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work one cannot help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness defeat lust love sadness melancholy that each person feels When I saw these films I perceived my future experiences how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events I acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives memories and contexts A masterpiece and a revelation I only wish the BBC would screen it againbr br If anyone knows where I can get a copy could they contact me,1
Not the film to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated If you want to have a lot of fun a the theater however this is the one Lots of snappy banterand some really cheesy banter too Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as the comic relief Exciting and creative heists and chase scenes Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theronsexyare appealing leads And Donald Sutherland,1
At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing Im kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with Shaun of the Dead Now given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius I realise this is a rather big claim And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether Fido will appeal to youbr br In a way the comedy picks up where Shaun left off except were back in the original 1950s Living Deadera stereotypical middleAmerican small town The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more welladjusted useful members of the community This so were informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps br br The beauty of the film lies in its deadpan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individualbr br Its a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the films allround strong cast Its one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part Its also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been likebr br So in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you,1
If this film is examined closely its a bit sad It is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children who grow up in poor dysfunctional environments Yet it retains its comedic value with spirited performances by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones The sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother Carroll who cannot truly help her children not because she doesnt want to or try but because its obvious she doesnt know how Remember this is a comedy but if youve never seen this or if you have watch this film and see the humanity in the characters Good film,1
I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it I was very pleased with the movie I thought it was a wonderful plot Its a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say And this wife stayed devoted for 23 years I thought it was a great movie,1
I went to see this film because Joaquim de Almeida was in it Joaquim had a fairly small part so it was good that I liked the film on its own In fact I liked it a lotbr br The film centers around two characters Albert and Louie Albert is a shy retiring sort and Louie well Louie is not The story revolves around Louies request to Albert to let him come over to Alberts place for just a little while Louie has just gotten out of prisonbr br Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and its Albert who always takes the fallbr br The action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from Louies visit On The Run is a chronicle of madcap zany situations However Bruno de Almeida and scriptwriter Joseph Minion After Hours dont always take you where you expect to go There are twists and turns that add depth to this film Of course there is plenty of outright comedy but there is much subtle humor here as wellbr br There are some downright good performances here as well Albert is played delightfully by Michael Imperioli Hes getting fairly wellknownthese days from the HBO series The Sopranosbr br Louie is played by John Ventimiglia who imbues his character with a lovable childlike quality no matter what he does you just gotta love Louiebr br Both these actors are excellent in their individual characters With Imperioli youll want to hug him and bring him home to Mom Ventimiglia well you wont know whether you should slap him or bring him home and NOT to Mompbr br There are other standout performances as well The character of Rita is played by Drena DeNiro yes Roberts daughter The audience adored her In talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who was their favorite of those two But everyone loved Ritabr br Is this film perfect No I cant say that it is There were many times I wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with There were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and noticebr br The ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget Yet budget or no budget the ending screen shot in my opinion brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable emotionally effective scenebr br,1
Yes Georgio is a lighthearted and enjoyable moviecomedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music Its not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD Although a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarottis operatic talents oftentimes an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person Yes Georgio permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would notbr br Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable I dont agree Enormously talented people can be both selfcentered and charming charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people Additionally people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the otherbr br Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities The ending scenes from Puccinis Turandot alone are worth the time to get there,1
This gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated Its pure delight and fun Gratuitous servings of blood insanity and black humor which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre A full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot Only for the connoisseurs,1
Dr Bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it The thing about him is that he is depressed Dr Bock and his wife separated his children are deviant he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isnt doing a very good job at healing people He becomes suicidal but meets Barbara who changes his ideas for the better All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outsidebr br The movie is well done and the character of Dr Bock is well played out Its a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama It was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr Bock was doing Great movie,1
Ive been playing this movie incessantly this month and I just love it I was around in the 60s oh dear so it is nostalgic in one sense However its the funny premise the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watchingbr br Dr Winstons reactions to Stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless Id be more specific but dont want to spoil it for anyone Who other than Matthau can play a man not entirely on the upandup and yet have us still love him As for Bergmans costumes I think she looks as dowdy as shes supposed to I think she was robbed the one time that she appears in an evening gown It doesnt suit her at all which is too bad I never liked it when I first saw it on her and I still dontbr br Goldie won an Oscar for her role People thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time and yet its the one performance that I dont love as much as the others She does have the right amount of sweetness and likability however which is important for this rolebr br And I agree I thought Rick Lenz was great in it and its too bad that his movie career didnt take off after thisbr br I hope more people watch this movie theyll love it,1
WOW Talk about a film that divides the audience This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie Personally I really enjoyed it I noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND People can be real stupid No this film is far more in common with The Thing how people fail to notice is amazing they even have the same basic music Lots of Carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood Perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is its deference to other Carpenter works Not least Dark Star which it has something in common with Id be interested to know how much it REALLY cost 8000 Is that even possible Maybe it was based on a short film that cost 8000 But I did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died They are so underplayed that its like watching a documentary at times Having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and Im not sure the big guy playing the Captain is one of them But his gun is AWESOME Give it a chance if you like early Carpenter you might fall for it just dont expect 2001,1
This movie tries to run away to the typical Im fighting because Im obliged to defend the fatherland The NAZIs are all bad guys Im against them typical of German war movies How By not talking too much about it and just referring the war and the POWs Nevertheless I would like to see a German movie which would be something between the extremity of Come And See and the bad NAZIs Das Boot I say this because excluding this factor the German movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the German side You easily see some of the German hierarchical relations very different from the ones in US armybr br This is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was Stalingrad and I was not there and I doubt most people were there now but if I would choose one movie depicting this battle for sure would not be the all American Enemy At The Gates Why do I say this Because even the best soldiers are not heros and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland This goes for all the ranks and in the end you see von Paulus giving the example,1
Homelessness or Houselessness as George Carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on Iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streetsbr br But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless That is Goddard Bolts lessonbr br Mel Brooks who directs who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival Jeffery Tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if Bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk Hes given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly Lesley Ann Warren an exdancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals Sailor Howard Morris and Fumes Teddy Wilson who are already used to the streets Theyre survivors Bolt isnt Hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killedbr br While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasnt necessary to plot I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly moneybr br Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others,1
I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally got around to watching itI really enjoyed watching this film as you dont get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this Very well done and but I would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost When you start watching the movie dont do anything else I would actually advise people to read all the reviews hereincluding the ones with spoilers before watching the movie Raima Sen gave her first great performance that I have seen Aishwarya was easily at her best All performances were strong directing and cinematographygo watch it,1
I try to catch this film each time its shown on tv which happily is quite often But I keep forgetting to video it As it is I practically know the script by heart but that doesnt stop me having a good cry in fact it probably adds to it as I cry knowing whats coming next Its such a lovely film well made well cast good photography I love it One of my top ten films,1
I didnt expect much when I rented this movie and it blew me away If you like good drama good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them youll love this moviebr br Engrossing,1
This is like something I have NEVER seen before It had me cracking up the whole time I dont think there was one scene that I didnt laugh through It is about a girl from the country in South who goes off to a big town for college At the school she befriends the RA across the hall When she realizes that he has no family to go to for Thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her Rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to doPropose She urges Cral to do something so he stands up and shouts something like Sorry mate but you are too late I already asked Becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes That all turns into Chaos Please watch this classic it is totally worth it I swear,1
This offbeat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews My question is why I think this movie is pretty good Dee Snider did very well for his first and only time directing He also plays the antagonist Captain Howdy Carelton Hendriks This movie seems to have a view of the future Although it came out back in 1998 it seems to be about modern issues Internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here Although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today Ill admit the story fell short a few times but that doesnt make this a bad movie at all Robert Englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better THe acting wasnt bad the characters were pretty good as well Hendriks was a pretty good antagonist I think I give this offbeat horror a 710 Recommend for fans of Saw,1
The movie was good Really the only reason I watched it was Alan Rickman Which he didnt pull off the southern accentbut he did pretty well with itKnow Emma Thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent I like all the character in my opinion not one of them did badanother thing I have notice I have read all these comment and not one person has comment on Alan 5 0clock shadow Which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie I would give the movie a 9 out of 10 Another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasnt any sex Still it was alright Love the scene were he says Aw sht when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror,1
Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven The scene when they meet again in Willys flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semiretired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization George Burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable Watch for the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker and Als reaction priceless,1
Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down We expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20s were a bit more innocent William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford the town nerd The movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports Its a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century,1
I remember watching American Gothic when it first aired it came into my mind recently all I could remember was the same guy appeared in Midnight Caller which is Gary Cole I dont watch much TV but I watched American Gothic I purchased the Complete Series on DVD this week its still as good as ever This is one of the best TV series ever the reason I dont watch much TV is because its just rubbish thats on except for Derren Brown its all Reality TV or Soaps such as Grease Big Brother etc im fed up with it I got the Complete Series of American Gothic for 1697 form the Asda website thats the cheapest I can find it,1
Coconut Freds Fruit Salad Island is a hilarious show that is on Saturday mornings on WB It stars Coconut Fred and all of his friends on the island and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs Most of the time it is because of Coconut Freds trouble making antics which makes it funny and other stuff going on on the island at the same time The humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all which adds it being as amusing as it is I dont think this could be funnier The voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated which adds to the shows hilarity If this is ever on DVD Im getting it ASAPbr br Strongly recommended for a good laugh,1
As a fan of Wm Faulkner since college I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons My grandfather also named Clarence Brown as was the director grew up in the Oxford area having been born near there in 1888 We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie It still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of Ole Miss My recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but I was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white I was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go Anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and I would love to know more about that story br br Now days Oxford is a larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and I hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years Juano Hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year but Hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so starring Tommy Lee Jones It really captured the intensity of rural Southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often,1
A great suspense movie with terrific slow camerawork adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy Directorwriter Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcockimitation many called it a ripoff with this film and the 2351 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camerawork and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formattedforTV tapesbr br The downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a preNYPD Dennis Franz who has hair here br br The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodiesbr br There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though its apparent who the killer is its still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women,1

This movie was absolutely wonderful The prepartition time and culture has been recreated beautifully Urmila has given yet another brilliant performance What I truly admire about this movie is that it doesnt resort to Pakistanbashing that is running rampant in movies like Gadar and LOC With the partition as a backdrop the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong The movie always centers around the tragic story of Urmilas life Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been depicted excellently The movie actually shows how the people both Hindus and Muslims have suffered from this partition The theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film,1
Im surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film The lions share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they differ In one version the version I have seen most often on broadcast TV the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the Brotherhood of the Protectors a fictional splinter group of priests and brothers excommunicated by the Church In the other version which Ive seen only once on TV the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official Church meaning the Archdiocese of New York or perhaps Brooklyn Also in the former version in most of the pertinent scenes the clerics are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say Father soandso but the dubbed audio says Brother soandso In the latter version I believe everyone is referred to as Fatherbr br In any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial reshooting of the other with all Brotherhood of the Protector scenes reshot as Archdiocese scenes or vice versa Kind of reminds me of the Raymond Burr cutaway scenes in Godzilla I have videotaped both versions off broadcast TV so no Im not imagining this Can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film,1
Dont watch this film while or soon after eatingbr br Having said that Begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life like it or not Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spasming above ground to paraphrase the title sequenceintroduction this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery youll ever see in a filmbr br There is no dialogue only image after image describing the cycle of life The films combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the makers messagebr br The movie begins with God portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth After his death Mother Nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and gives birth to Man represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earthbr br The landscape is a barren waste populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen upon Mother Nature and Man After a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of Nature and destruction of Man these humanoids proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground and the cycle of life begins anewbr br I actually rented this from Blockbuster one night based on the cover art and hype content but this is definitely not a Blockbustertype film Dont expect narrative dialogue or any pulled punches This is intense imagery based on a dark subjectbr br I give this movie some high marks for the filmwork and audio but I dont think Ill be watching it too often if again I like my movies dark and unique but this one is exponentially more than I expected,1
Walt Disneys 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself he died in late 1966 and is not generally considered to be among their very best output The main problem is that on the surface the film seems merely to be the feline version of either LADY AND THE TRAMP 1955 or 101 DALMATIONS 1961 both of which are certainly more beloved by fans Even so being both an animation and cat lover I dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat voiced by Eva Gabor and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of Paris by a wealthy lady Hermione Baddeleys greedy butler Luckily they meet a streetwise alley cat Phil Harris who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band led by Scatman Crothers and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs meanwhile at home Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song which includes a verse in French and Scatmans band indulge in a breezy number Evrybody Wants To Be A Cat,1
I first saw this movie at a video store and being the Bam Margera fan I am had to rent it to see what it was all about Since I have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor I found this movie absolutely hilarious Some of the parts are pointless and random but thats what makes them so amusing Youll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie I was really impressedbr br I was also surprised at the acting These people actually did a good job Nothing Oscar worthy but well enough to get past the amateur level Teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used I wouldnt suggest watching this with your parents and vice versabr br All in all the acting was great the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to,1
I loved it it was really gruesome and disgusting I thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about Jesus Christ was really interesting The tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome Dont watch this if you have a weak heart you wouldnt be able to stand it,1
Citizen KaneThe Godfather Part IIDUrville Martins Dolemite This is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity Rudy Ray Moore in a role that transcends Academy Awards stars as Dolemite the baddest cat in the universe He clearly does not take any jive from no turkey I myself am unfortunately a turkey and proves it with his powers of rapping pimping and karate chopping This is blaxploitation at its absolute finest a shining example of the genre with its low budget continuity errors and hatred for ratsoup eating honkey expletive expletive The true Godfather of Rap not this new Ali nonsense Moore is something of a juxtaposition of acting technique somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970s and thats saying something This one is HIGHLY recommended folks if not for the oneliners alone,1
OK On the whole this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with goings on in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe If you have read Stephen Hawkings brilliant book A Brief History of Time and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain conceptswhich i did to a certain extent Greene is bearable but obviously for the sake of the masses tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way This is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this seriesbr br The guest scientists were good no Hawking but i suppose he has his own DVDs I kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts very American weighted here with a few Brits and one antipodean I bought the Nova 2 Disc edition NTSC and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experiencebr br 1 The this is brought to you by at the start of EACH part was a necessary evil for the first part but seeing it 2 more times before It was over was very ordinarybr br 2 Cant be helped I suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the FFW button a few timesbr br 3 This disc set was straight from TVie ads what happen last show for those that missed it and frequent goto pbsorg for more appearing throughout the presentation quite unlike BBC material which is unmatched for presentationPlanets The Blue Planet etc My 710 is based on content alone The niggles were there but I got over them If this had have been done with that classic British accented presenter you know the one it would be a perfect Disc set in my opinionbr br If you have seen this and want morethen I highly recommend Hawkings book a Brief History of Time I wish it was a movie toobr br Happy viewing,1

I love this show as it action packed with adventure love and intrigue Well some times love Its so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect Its also very good to se Dick Van Dyke in a television role as I have only seen him in Mary Poppins the mixture of the main characters Mark Amanda Jesse and Steve is very capturing to the audience This is a show you have to watch,1
I saw the movie before I read the Michelle Magorian book and I enjoyed both The movie more than the book made me come close to tears on several occasions This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go I encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible I give it ten stars,1
Some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing Such is the case for CAROLS JOURNEY EL VIAJE DE CAROL a beautifully crafted 2002 film from Spain based on the novel A boca de noche by Ángel García Roldán who also adapted the book as a screenplay War and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genrebr br Carol Clara Lago is a 12yearold Spanish American youngster from New York who with her critically ill mother Aurora María Barranco returns to her Auroras home in 1938 at the height of the Spanish Civil War a home that has been left deserted by her father Don Amalio Álvaro de Luna since his wifes death Carols father Robert Ben Temple is a fighter pilot who has sided with the Republicans against Franco and is rarely with his family Aurora has a past she left her lover Alfonso Alberto Jiménez to marry Robert and Alfonso in turn married Auroras cold sister Dolores Lucina Gil Carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather Don Amalio until she meets others her age but not of her class Tomiche Juan José Ballesta and his two friends at first resent Carol but as events develop Carol and Tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love When Aurora dies of her illness Carol must live with Alfonso and Dolores and their daughter Blanca Luna McGill yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mothers best friend and teacher Maruja the always radiant Rosa Maria Sardà to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side Through a series of incidents Carol and Tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime The ending though sad is uplifting as Carols journey to maturity is completebr br The film is shot in Galicia and Portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer Gonzalo F Berridi and enhanced by the musical score by Bingen Mendizábal Director Imanol Uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war The cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles This is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date Grady Harp,1
ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newmans score Its haunting and beautiful but youre aware that this music is similar to Newmans other work and while listening to the soundtrack youre reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION youre reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY Irish gangsters is MILLERS CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leones gangster epics Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldnt be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you cant help thinking what a superb director Mendes is br br ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances Ive never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but hes every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role probably better Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent Newmans performance works due to the subtle body language his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadnt decided to become James Bond a role which heralds the end of an actors career,1
The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel DayLewis and Hugh OConor as Christy Brown guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing The enormous support that Christy got form his family lowincome working class Dubliners encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture Christy Browns witty arrogant personality I do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movielovers,1
Absolutely stunning warmth for the head and the heart The kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed too frenetic to even attempt My kids watched it and they loved it too What real peoplegoes to show you how cultural differences the Japanese setting is less important than the human similarities Go see it whether you like dancing or not,1
I recently saw this film at a 3D film festival in Hollywood It was in polarized 3D Gray glasses not red blue It was so much fun to watch this film with an audience the print was excellent and the 3D perfect The performances were over the top and that added to the fun the surprise ending that we arent supposed to share with fellow movie goers at least according to the movie trailer and poster had people howling with laughter By todays standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3D complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen this film was an entertaining romp into 50s horror,1
Michael Stearns plays Mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it He believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty So he strolls through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a highpowered rifle with a scopebr br The seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again The story comes off as more of an afterthought This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation Of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism For one thing Mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger This is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackbr br Those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and renders him uncertain how to react It unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist Its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screenbr br 710,1
I saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago and I havent forgotten it to this day I couldnt say whether its a good picture But in those days I instantly fell in love with Jean Simmons The memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but I still remember the plot Simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling David Leans GREAT EXPECTATIONS And again it was the young Jean Simmons Its a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video Id like to correct my memories,1

Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby S Epatha Merkerson Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman She epitomized strength will power confidence and resolve She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject Her tenants consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary Each successive event Rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly She wasnt a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite She displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to overextend herselfbr br Merkerson did a good job but I believe this role was right up her alley anyway The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel There were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected Nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than Rachel herself,1
This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I ever saw I absolutely enjoyed the plot because by the way the story was developing you would get more involved on how their world was really upsidedown There is just only one part that doesnt really seem to fit in the movie which is the girls strip It does not add anything important to the story it looks like its just there for a men entertaining purpose The ending is a bit unexpected though at the same time somewhat expected If you dont understand then follow me after so many strange occurrences the viewer is so used to oddities that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships Like Mimoso and Susana sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie But most of all Sorte Nula is a movie that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious occourings laugh your head off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes when you turn your back away from something for all that I rate it 810,1
Considering the big name cast and lavish production I expected a lot more of this film The acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best However the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent,1

If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then Tigerland is the film for you I love this movie from top to bottom This movies pictureperfect scenes look so real its almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama Boy I tell you REAL drama they actually real fought in one of the scenes get the DVD listen to the commentary its not obvious I see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an illfated destiny after watching Saving Private Ryan I have an a appreciation of what an illfated destiny is and know exactly how the men in the film feel I see this movie as a crossbreed between Stand By Me and Saving Private Ryan What do men do when they are with a situation thats hard pressed in real life Some men go crazy some men cry some men through fists others do drugs some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life some try drink the pain away some jump off buildings or bridges some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse physically This movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball But dont get me wrong its not depressing movie its realistic its a very very humorous movie the cocky and funny Bozz Collins Character lights it all up and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie Ill let you figure out what their in there for With dialogue waraction sequences picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music this movie has it all like I said from top to bottom I dont why Tigerland is heavily undercredited The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing The best film of the year and it absolutely falls nothing short of that Keep the rare gems coming Hollywood 1010,1
This is one particular Stooge short that actually uses satire in conjunction with slapstick a rarity As mentioned the title and concept for this short was borrowed from a feature film from the same year with Clark Gable called Men In White Its basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for duty and humanity I saw this recently and almost treated it like the Stooge version because it does take itself a little too seriously In any case Men In Black is so well written directed and not to mention original it didnt borrow a thing from Chaplin or any of the others that the Motion Picture Academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934 Some stinky short called La Cucaracha outdid it though and stole the award Some producers brother in law must have been on the Academys voting board Men In Black pokes fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the Marx Bros always did at this time May not be a fair comparison but I can see the Marx Bros in this short In fact in their feature A Day At The Races there is a scene where theres medical things going on and they cause anarchy as usual My guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place Try this in fact watch this short first and then watch Duck Soup or Day at the Races with the Marxes and then see if there isnt the same great quality of comedy,1

At the end of my review of Cache I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste which I just finished watching about a half hour agobr br Its all been expressed here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews the gruesomely twisted pathology that would create an individual like Hupperts Erika who is still trying after years and years to please her mother at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life beginning with her self Shes repressed everything that would free her from her selfimposed bondage including of course her sexuality which has literally imploded to the point of madness to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel likebr br This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult I think this subject relates to all of us were all striving for autonomy but there are needs so many conflicting needs most of which are not even on the conscious level It also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about sexually and the reality of those fantasies as well as the consequences of choosing to share ones sexual fantasies with another human being Hupperts character gets what she asks for in the course of the film and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be br br Regarding the muchdiscussed scene in the bathroom I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge for the viewer I mean sucked out of it because of the prior scene where she put the glass in the girls pocket By the time shes acting out her letsseeifthisguyisworthy scenario in the bathroom weve already found out that shes dangerously disturbed and so its not a turn on her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupebr br I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how about halfway through it I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading subtitles That has never happened before in any foreign movie and Ive seen quite a few br br In this film like Cache the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow but unlike Cache we do at least get some sense of finality despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Hupperts character is alive or dead After experiencing La Pianiste when it comes to Michael Haneke I am needless to say more than a trifle intrigued,1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series And while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very bestbr br The movie interestingly enough is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts In so many ways the show is much like the film THE ENEMY BELOWwhere the American Captain Robert Mitchum and the German Captain Curt Jurgens are shown in counterpoint as they both try to outwit the otherand in the process develop a grudging respect for their foebr br Interestingly enough only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planetand this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull But because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader Oddly for the diehard Trekkers out there theyll recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spocks fatherbr br The bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat,1

I have to confess that I know some of those involved I was in the forerunner to The Planet Evil Unleased however this was more than 10 years ago and I had since lost contact with them I happened to be watching BBC Scotland News and a piece regarding Scottish Cinema this mentioned and showed clips from The Planet and comments from its director Mark Stirton this prompted me to order a copy of the film on DVDbr br Now to the film the level of acting writing directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around OK its not Star Wars but Ive seen many a Hollywood product that is far inferior It is very strange watching a film spoken in my local North East Scotland accent but that soon passedbr br Mild Spoilersbr br The Planet draws on several scifi classics Star Wars Alien Pitch Black Forbidden Planet and Predator a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible attackers the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survivebr br The Planet is a brilliant piece of scifi film making that certainly hides its limited budget well done to Mark Mike and all those involved I look forward to your next work,1
Excellent Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the womans role and place A moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences Low budget independent film never made any money Definitely not the romanticized unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life,1
I was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a Swedish film with subtitles However I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features I particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence An absolute gem of a film that I will promote to all who will listen,1
Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets Deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general together with other animal movies like Old Yeller Napoleon Fluke and Air Bud This means it is more than just a movie about petsbr br Can this possibly be just a remake It is too good to be a remake I know this one by heart since my early teen years when I was 12br br Its a family movie to treasure Its emotional thrilling adventurous exciting entertaining humorous charming sweet nostalgic beautiful heartwarming and sometimes dramatic Its one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of filmsbr br This movie does not lack qualities It has a well thought story enjoyable characters excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack dazzling scenerieslandscapes of the magnificent Sierra mountains in Oregon Speaking of the vistas its not all mountains forests trees rivers waterfalls sunsets in conclusion all of pure natures wonders truly a full panorama br br The main human characters are nice well developed and well portrayed by respective actors Robert Hays is awesome as the kindhearted dad Bob Seaver Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford Veronica Lauren is equally good as Hope Kevin Chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother Jamie his appearance actually reminds me very much of Kevin Corcoran in Old Yeller Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnfordbr br When it comes to our quadruped pals Shadow is my favorite Shadow is the loyal wise mature beautiful caring and loving old Golden Retriever brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche Chance the American Bulldog is the opposite of Shadow He is carefree silly impatient anxious clumsy hilarious and loves to play voiced by the talented Michael J Fox Chance just cant stand still Sassy is the epitome of catss image elegant independent very confident and selfproud with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat one of the most beautiful cat breeds Sassy is voiced by Sally Field who also does a good jobbr br Our fourlegged friends are themselves great actors by nature Ben as Shadow Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassybr br Its an underrated movie but a classic by its own right Its sequel is clearly inferiorbr br This should definitely be on Top 250,1

In his first go as a Hollywood director Henry Brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a fatherson hitman business The film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift familyconscious screenplay also by Brommell that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre As a bonus Panic delivers subtle acerbic humoran unexpected undeniably charming and very welcome surprisethrough its bumbling unsureofhimself lowkey star whose evercool state is enticing especially given his line of workbr br The forevergreat William H Macy again captures our hearts as Alex a unhappy torn middleaged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious of persons a young attractive equallymessedup 23yearold named Sarah Neve Campbell whom he meets in the waitingroom at a psychologists office where he awaits the therapy of Dr Josh Parks John Ritter to discuss his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father Donald Sutherland built Alex whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father strikes an unwise fancy for Sarah which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and more importantly to him a good father to his sixyearold son Sammy played enthusiastically by the endearing David Dorfmanbr br Henry Brommells brilliant Panic is something of a rarity in Hollywood seldom seen with the exception of 2002s Road to Perdition since its conception in 2000it weaves two conflicting genres organizedcrime family drama into a fascinating warm hunk of movieviewing that is evenly strong in either directionand its one that will maintain its exceptional infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come,1
One of the few comedic Twilight Zones thats actually really good We have Floyd The Barber from Andy Griffith ShowThe stock in trade Old Geezer dude from Many old westernsand lovable old Frisby It also has that cool spacecraft interior that I believe was used in the Sci Fi classic Forbidden PlanetOr else The Day The Earth Stood SillPlus the new guys in town are driving an exotic RenaultI think sports car back in the days when European automobiles were known as Foreign Jobs in the US The whole idea of harmonica as weapon is a hootAnd the fact that Frisbys buddies love him despite being the fact hes a total BS artist is a heartwarming moment,1
This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience The many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victims mind are arrogant As a victim I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role of Maya I agree that this is an incredibly brave film This looks at rape from a different more realistic standpoint than any other movie Ive ever seen on the subject The end did drag on a bit long but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1 Its good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to,1
What I Like About You is definitely a show that I couldnt wait to see each day Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show The Amanda Show Shes a very funny person and seems to be down to earth Holly is such a likeable person and has an outthere personality I enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down so she messed herself up at times But thats what made the show so greatbr br I especially loved the show when the character Vince came along Nick Zano is very HOT and funny as well as Gary Wesley Jonathan The whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm Jennie Garth Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting I especially loved Lauren shes the best She helped make the show extra funny and you never know what shes gonna do or say next Overall the show is really nice but the reason I didnt give it a 10 was because theres no more new episodes and because the episodes couldve been longer and more deep,1
The turning point in The Matador comes about half through the movie when Danny an unsophisticated man from Denver is sitting in the balcony of his Mexico City hotel enjoying a quiet moment Someone knocks on his door and knowing its Julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer But did he really br br Richard Shephard the director of The Matador presents us with a character Julian Noble who shows no redeemable qualities In fact we have already seen him in action doing what he does best When Julian meets Danny at the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a livingbr br Danny who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract Danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian Its not until some time later on a cold winter night that the killer appears at Dannys door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson Its at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected waybr br Pierce Brosnan acting against type makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble Just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character Greg Kinnear on the other hand plays the straight part of this odd couple Hope Davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didnt she stay longer Philip Baker Hall puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignmentsbr br Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything,1
Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late 60s satire Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governors tax return who sensing that the future is in computers poses by means of a deft piece of identity theft as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinationalbr br Ustinov who cowrote the script is on top form as is the delightful Maggie Smith here unusually cast as an accidentprone cockneysparrow dolly bird Bob Newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith In addition Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as Ustinov and Newharts womanising bossbr br What do I particularly like about this film Not only is it a wellthoughtout caper movie but its also a touching little love story Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effectivebr br So what is there not to like Well the script is no more computerliterate than most films that is hardly at all even though it captures the feel of late 60s big iron business computing quite well Also there are a couple of small plot glitches that youre not likely to notice until the second or third viewing but I consider these to be minor nigglesbr br As I said this is a film which is well worth seeking out and after youve seen it once youll want to see it again at regular intervalsbr br,1
Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notchI highly recommend this movie Her performance in my opinion was Academy Award material The only real sad fact here is that Universal hasnt seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or DVD They are ignoring a VERY good movie But Universal has little regard for its library on DVD which is sad If you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it I wont go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available anywherebr br a 10,1
The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shellys Ill Take You There is not overt but clearly has ties to his work Shelly has acted in two of Hartleys films Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyperstylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light Though this film is not ironic on the whole thank God the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies Ill See You There is a great indiefilm that doesnt stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotionbr br The film begins with Bills life falling to pieces Not only has he sold his best friend Ray a beautiful country home but his wife Rose has left him in order to join Ray in the retreat All washed up Bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister Lucy played by the director Adrienne Shelly brings him all kinds of surprises a selfhelp book and a date for her traumatized brotherbr br The unwilling Bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of Bernice at his door leaves him no choice No doubt Bernices initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her However her pseudohippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date And Bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him To what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho And who better to play the psycho than Ally Sheedybr br Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose Bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first On the way she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun a Pinkerton Detective no less An imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose of course with a few stops along the way,1
When in 1982 The Thing came out to theaters everywhere it had a cold reception and very poor boxoffice results becoming almost a failure in John Carpenters career as a horror director however time has proved that The Thing was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the films fault Nowadays John Carpenters The Thing has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic and not without a reason as this new version of John W Campbell Jrs story Who Goes There previously adapted as The Thing From Another World is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoiabr br The plot of The Thing begins in the winter of 1982 in a US research station located in the remote territories of Antarctica when the members of the crew notice a Norwegian helicopter coming their way The two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a Husky dog who makes its way into the American base After the Norwegians are killed accidentally the Americans try to figure out what made them to be insane Soon theyll discover that the Husky dog the Norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog but a creature able to mimic every living creature and not only that it has a tremendous hungerbr br Director John Carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher Halloween where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock The Thing could be seen as an evolution of that style as even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottins special effects which were labeled by critics as repulsive on its day the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent and very welldone displays of gore The feeling of loneliness as well as the bad karma between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the Thing even our main character R J MacReady Kurt Russell ending in a situation where nobody can be trustedbr br This plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was blatantly ignored by the previous version not completely a bad thing just a big difference making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel Bill Lancasters script handles the characters with brilliant domain giving us enough to distinguish them but not too much to completely trust them making them an essential factor in the films haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie The mystery and the suspense are at the max as never one can tell who is the Thing and who is normal enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent resultsbr br The cast is very effective and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real Carpenters regular collaborator Kurt Russell as MacReady carries the film and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse Definitely one of his best performances Wilford Brimley is also terrific as Dr Blair a scientist that goes insane after discovering the Things purposesbr br The Thing is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed although they exist The most notorious being the very lowkey and at times unappropriated score by Ennio Morricone Its not exactly bad but it just feels out of place at some scenes and its not one of the best works by the legendary composer Also due to some misshapes with the special effects some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes although nothing of big importance or actually annoyingbr br When talking about John Carpenters films most people will almost instantly name Halloween as his favorite film but personally I would go with The Thing as I consider it Carpenters greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made I would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made 1010,1
If you liked Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the chances are youll like this too Although I guess a few of the British injokes like calling two London characters Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal soccer players may be lost on some this is still cracking entertainment which veritably pumps with vitalitybr br Carlyle Miller and Tyler are all excellent bringing depth to their characters and the interplay between the two protagonists is always welljudged In fact Scotts direction is very assured considering that this is his first feature film and proves that he has his fathers talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundingsbr br Hell Ive convinced myself Im gonna see it again,1

Ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for Jean de Florrette HELLO this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point This film is clearly made for people who dont appreciate the so called american humour which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap The point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth offbr br Thankyou,1

Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not overthink their movies br br Lots of action lots of great dialogue eg fun to quote a little intrigue and stuff blowing up all over the place Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry Violent but not gory The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turnaboutbr br Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months I initially rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the film but was caught up in the events surrounding Samanthas quest to regain her memory and have never looked backbr br All you cerebral folks out there suspend disbelief for once take yourself a little less seriously you might actually enjoy yourselves,1
Samuel Fuller is hardly one of Americas great directors Im not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywoods great craftsmen But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywoods true professionals who were willing to march to their own music During the time he worked for Hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its partson time and on budget Pickup on South Street is a case in point On the surface its one more of Hollywoods early Fifties antiCommie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hardboiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut exciting drama with any number of offkilter twists The hero Skip McCoy is a threetime loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesnt change his stripes until the very end The girl in the caper Candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if youre so inclined One of the most appealing characters Moe Williams is a stoolie And in an unusual approach to Hollywoods battle against Commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears the hero isnt motivated by anything so ennobling He just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becomingat least for nowa good guy br br Plus all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio He had to make do Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but Jean Peters is a surprise She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friendsor her clientswant her to be And Richard Kiley who later would become a two time Tony award winning star on Broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly Its hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us I mean introduced to us The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha br br More than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the Feds and the Commies moves straight ahead with great economy The whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell The dialogue with Fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hardboiled pulp fiction style That muffin you griftedshes okay one character says to Skip about Candy Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability br br The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fullers talents and strengths In 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters Skip and Candy were going to be involved with And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us br br Says Glenn Erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics In what should be an inconsequential story Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up stiffnecked aggressive selfinterest that when fully expressed recognizes whats wrong and whats right and isnt afraid to fight for it As always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort Hes right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years,1

I first heard about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube He literally slapped the show with a big bad rant condemning it rubbish and confusing Curious I decided to watch the show once I got the order of the episodes right thanks to those who made the lists and I found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch Great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious a unique and not over blowing plot that makes sense now that Ive watched the show and two of the best anime moments in history in my opinion Plus the opening and ending themes are greatbr br The anime based on a collection of successful manga novels follows a simple plot once you understand it While the shows focus is on the main character Haruhi Suzumiya the point of view is from her friend Kyon Kyon is a regular high school student who doesnt really believe in supernatural stuff eg Santa Clause aliens time travellers ghosts espers but he soon ends up talking to Haruhi who is the most oddest girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien considering all men worthless She even joined every club in the school to find something interesting but quit as quickly as she joined Upon advice from Kyon Haruhi decides to form her own club with Kyons club Setting up in the literary club room Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade its mission to investigate supernatural cases think ScoobyDoo minus the dog the masked man and the Mystery Machinebr br Haruhi recruits three extra members The first is Yuki Nagato a bookworm of sorts who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting The second is Mikuru Asahina a shy girl who is forced into the club by Haruhi who thinks they need a cute mascot to get some things done She is often forced into costumes by Haruhi to further her cuteness The third is Itsuki Koizumi a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling While Haruhi thinks her group is filled with normal people she couldnt be more wrong While Kyon is as normal as you can get the other three on the other hand are rather unique Yuki is an alien Mikuru is a time traveller from the future and Itsuki is an esper a person who has ESP All three have come to watch over Haruhi who may just have the powers of a god and if she becomes bored she may be able to discover her powers and create a whole new world and Kyon is involved somehowbr br The show is worth watching with great characters music and some hilarious and wonderful moments However for parents there is some sexual references including Mikurus cleavage being exposed or touched several times and several swear words used as well Apart from that the show is one of the greats,1
Well Ive enjoy this movie even though sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation I didnt understood at this time if the Punishment Park has exist in the past but I think the matter isnt really herebr br You have to look at this movie in a different manner It shows how much violence you can find in our world It reminds us that we live in a world who is lead by violence and that nobody can escape from it If anyone refuse to take his responsabilities then you will be thrown out of our societyAll our history is made by wars we should never forget this In fact its only when we will finally accept the truth that maybe we will change and understand that our intellectual skills have improve So we could use them to find others ways to resolve our problemsbr br In 2 words this movie is a must see maybe it will help us to accept the truth,1

I waited until the 4th of July to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this daybr br In 1924 DW Griffith needed a hit he had not had a big one since ORPHANS OF THE STORM 1921 Hed been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution DAR who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the American Revolution This movie is the result By the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasnt a trace of Patrick Henry anywherebr br We all know the story of the Revolutionary War but Griffith threw in a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan Neil Hamilton falling in love with Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague Carol Dempster a leading lady for Griffith for many years Complicating matters is the fact that Nancys father hates Nathan well not just Nathan he hates all rebels It does not help matters when during a skirmish on the streets of Lexington someone jostles Nathans arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound Nancys dadbr br Paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of Capt Walter Butler Lionel Barrymore a renegade British officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one With Thousands of Indians form the Six Nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empirebr br Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION 1915 are inevitable The Montague family might just as well be the Camerons from the earlier film while Nathan could be a part of the Stoneman family The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is staged very similarly to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army in this case the Redcoats storming a trench packed with Patriots The only thing missing is Henry Walthall charging across No Mans Land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon Amazingly enough the battle scenes in America seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in BIRTH and fail to draw the audience in Something is clearly missing It isnt scope GW Billy Bitzers camera work is quite good Maybe what is missing is dare I say it sinceritybr br The brutality of Capt Butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen Dont expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in INTOLERANCE 1916 In one scene Butlers second in command Capt Hare Louis Wolhiem gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist We see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on Hares face as he obviously has a good time doing this Lionel had been working with Griffith on and off since 1912 A story goes that he approached Griffith for work and DW knowing the reputation of his famous family said I am not hiring stage actors to which Lionel replied And I am nothing of the kind sir He makes a very good and quite believable villain Louis Wolhiem appeared with Lionels older brother John three times in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE both 1920 and later in THE TEMPEST 1927 As Capt Hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad alsobr br Neil Hamilton later remarked that America was his first time on horseback and I was scared to death He hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over Mr Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked her to marry him She refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually wanedbr br Speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of Paul Reveres ride He rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce To arms The Regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground I am amazed Griffith did not do another takebr br So is America a classic YES Dont wait for July 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime,1
This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voiceover that pokes fun at everything French and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe Portrayed by the splendid Gerard Philippe the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells notably that he will marry King Louis XVs daughter Problem is La Lollo soon find outs she too is in love with Fanfanbr br Propelled by good sword fights cavalcades and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so unseriously that I could not give those shortcomings a second thought Look out for Noel Roquevert a traditional heavy in French films trying to steal La Lollo making himself a nuisance and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads La Lollos hand And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lustdriven King Louis XV That is not all So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952 The film may have come out that year but its verve cheek superb narration immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular Do see it,1
hello looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night Cant find what your looking for I thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie Good for the whole family I found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike It was brilliant to say the least Bruce Williss acting was topnotch there was a lot of humor in it and overall a great movie In my opinion its a mustsee movie And I dont think that about a lot of movies believe me when I say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that Its clear that there was much work done by Bruce Willis and cast to get this movie done Excellent story good acting and again overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie,1
An amazing piece of film that was wellconceived and kept me on the edge of my seat Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release The acting was generally welldone the Director shouldve asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons and the shot selections were impressive as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio This movie didnt let up since the opening scene,1
Damien ODonnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalzbr br This is a fantastic film its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently Tell everyone you know to go see it now FANTASTICbr br The acting is excellent and Dublin plays a starring role This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema I cant wait til it comes out on DVD,1
As you can see I loved the book so much I use the title for my internet alias and have for over 15 years Okay so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name character limit for the BBS at the time but what could I do If anyone every finds this movie I would absolutely love to see it Janet McTeer is great in everything else Ive seen of hers I think she would have made a great Prue And it even features early Clive Owen from before Chancer a great series itself Whats not to love I hope the powers that be wise up and make this available on DVD soon With some of the true dredge they pout out its about time well executed productions make it on the market too,1
I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web I thought Cinderella 2 as well as 3 is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone kids and adultslike me I am 22 years oldbr br I also find it and very informative film it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart I thought it has great animation and the voice casting was very good the songs performed by Brooke Allison too Since this film has been divided into three flashbacksstories my favorite out of the three is the story of when Jaq the mouse became a human for a day thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic,1

The only thing serious about this movie is the humor Well worth the rental price Ill bet you watch it twice Its obvious that Sutherland enjoyed his role,1
2005 was one of the best year for movies We had so many wonderful movies like Batman Begins Sin City Corpse Bride A History of ViolenceComing up we also got Brokeback Mountain King KongBut if this year the only great movie that came out was Everything Is Illuminated then we wouldnt miss all this year has brought The first movie as a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful heartwarming touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Woods best roles He is perfect as Jonathan a curious man that heads for Ukraine to find the woman who saved his Grandfather in World War II Liev Schreiber who also writes the movie conducts a masterpiece with memorable scenes and a lot of funny quotes This here is a genuine mixture of Comedy with Drama bringing a movie that will be commented years from now A serious Oscar contender Everything is Illuminated is a powerful original and why not say illuminated movie But theres one thing you should remember while entering the movie leave normal behind This is special910,1
According to John Fords lyrically shot fictional biopic of Abraham Lincolns life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way Fords camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr Lincolns early life But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames Ford has a unique eye for telling a story The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee one of his best rolesbr br The film concerns two young men brothers on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed In classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest Abe steps into the fray He charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer What follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murderdramas thereafter as Abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing linksbr br The film plays out like many John Ford movies do a tablespoon of Americana a dash of moderate predictability a hint of sarcasm that you arent sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself Despite the overtly Hollywood feel of the film and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincolns future presidency the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt,1
I dont think that many films especially comedies have added memorable quotable dialog like MOONSTRUCK I wont illustrate it you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me It is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory How about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client Or a nice elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon Or Perry John Mahoneys description of a female students youthful promise as moonlight in a martini my favorite linebr br MOONSTRUCK is a wonderful example of brilliant script first rate direction and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly There are other examples the drama THE OXBOW INCIDENT is another example but a grimmer one Cher Olympia Dukakis Vincent Gardenia Nicholas Cage John Mahoney and Danny Aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love and how to handle it Is it a good thing to be totally in love Cher and Cage at the end seem to think so but Dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy and Cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too when he and Cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera La Boheme Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death Dukakis believes so and oddly enough although he is not totally convinced Aiello Chance reveals infidelity Dukakis realizes early that Gardenias odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness and Cher literally stumbles onto Gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera but Gardenia also stumbles onto Chers similar unfaithfulness to Aiello But chance also causes misunderstandings Fyodor Chaliapin stumbles on Dukakis walking with John Mahoney and thinks that she is having an affairbr br There are lovely little moments in the film too Chers observation about flowers leading to receiving one Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and its resolution But best is the sequence of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasso as Chers uncle and aunt Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Ritas charming and kind comment to Raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him It is the sweetest moment of the entire filmbr br It is close to a flawless film After seeing it over a dozen times in as many years I can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be When Cher is at Cages bakery his assistant Chrissy Nada Despotovich mentions how she is secretly in love with Cage but has been afraid to tell him Earlier she was slightly snippy towards Cher who put her in her place quickly Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry At the same time the fact that Cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunts daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film but just as quickly dropped Was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped besides one about Cher and Vincent Gardenia working at a homeless mans shelter as penance It is a small annoyance but I think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good,1
This time around Blackadder is no longer royalor even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the Prince Regent portrayed by Hugh Lauriewho replaces Tim McInnerny who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we cant help but care for him which isnt at all true of his replacement as being intolerably daftwhich he apparently was according to the Trivia page not to mention loudmouthed and utterly nonthreatening Edmund can now do just about what he pleases and does so Why is he so frustrated and angryhonestly it gets depressing at times Yes his master is a buffoon they always are He doesnt seem to lack money nor is he in any danger In the second series the Queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someones head or marry them on a whim Here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting There is still commentary and even a little satire Too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely restate it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags And I cant tell you how many of them I figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away Its not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered Baldrick doesnt change from last season hes still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor Frankly the amount goes through the roof Dont get me started on the grossout stuff The sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before Id say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didnt really get me into them at all I was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were I could see many of such coming a mile away Some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced This continues with the tradition started by II of letting the plans work out occasionally The theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative All in all this is by far my least favorite of the four I recommend it to fans of the franchise and of British comedy in general 710,1
Now this is what Id call a good horror With occultsupernatural undertones this nice lowbudget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene This proves you dont need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror moviebr br The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmatesbr br I wont say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen There a few flaws though the FX are not that good but theyre used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but Malefique redeems itself by the time its overbr br I thought his was a very good movie 810,1

From the first scene I was really excited I can tell this is going to be awesome I thought The acting was so good I felt as though I was eavesdropping on these peoples lives The music too was exquisitely unsettling The plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward one could sense toward some irrevocable fate The build was slow but I personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesnt get derailed before its ready to pay offbr br So everythings going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling WHAT was all I and my movienight companion could say If you understand the directors intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcriticcom but I cant help saying it was not pulled off quite rightbr br This probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax In any case its too bad Those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world But for those of you who dont write or make films you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a HUGE pain in the butt and I am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestalbr br Wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished But hay Id take a blunted masterpiece any day over an overproduced piece of dogpoo overcompensated with too many digital effects like most horror movies these daysbr br One other comment Some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether I should be scared or laughing I dont know how to explain it but there was a distinctively Monty Python feel about this monster in his more blatent monster forms Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movieI dont know it still worked for me in some crooked way I will never look at deer antlers in the same way again,1
What if a platoon of GIs from the Japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate Great pitch right The movie does exactly what it says on the tinbr br Thankfully the writers didnt bother to explain the usually ridiculous in scifi movies scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport No hows or whys They just did However the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful if not a bit dated Not as silly as one would imaginebr br The rest of the movie follows the premise to a T But while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the GIs arrival to medieval Japan it picks up with a devastating battle sequence Undoubtedly its the main order of the day The whole concept and by extension the movie itself was probably originated from this simple pitch what if GIs equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais And boy does it deliverbr br The main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of THE best of its kind in 70s actionwar movies Not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length its also a terrific mishmash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like GI Samurai can deliver I mean where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ninjas complete with shuriikens a helicopter and samurais in the same shot The GI platoon led by lieutenant Iba tears literally through hundreds of extras gunning them down with machine guns mortars grenades and tanksbr br This mishmash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidaigeki epic of Kurosawas Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagakis Samurai Banners while the other is in western action and war movies There are stylistic touches like the wonderful slowmotion shots and bloody violence that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G Castellari circa Keoma to mind Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood works and vice versa and GI Samurai effortlessly turns this eastmeetswest melting pot into an exciting filmbr br The filmmakers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it Not that tongueincheek mentality is completely absent its just that it doesnt try to pander to sobaditsgood audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies The budget was probably hefty as it is evident in the hundreds of extras elaborate costumes very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidaigeki and special effects The camerawork and editing are all top notch almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deservesbr br Its not withouts its flaws either of course There are many song scenes where all sorts of 70s Japanese rock disco and country songs play over montages theres a bonding scene a loveinterest scene a war is hell scene etc The songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing Although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes it flies like a bullet for the most part Still some scenes flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effectbr br The cast also deserves a mention featuring such prominent names as Sonny Chiba Isao Natsuyagi Goyokin Samurai Wolf Tsunehiko Watase The Yakuza Papers and Hiroyuki Sanada all of them hitting the right notes,1
This allbutignored masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie Head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following Head was written by Jack Nicholson Rafelson and Peter Tork during a threeday LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel The other three Monkees only acted in itbr br They fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script They deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge br br For instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch framebyframe you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yells cutbr br The Monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are That ends up being the core of the Revelation soon to comebr br At every turn they realize their increasinglybizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they cant escape being in You say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the sets background No problem Hey hey theyre the Monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around br br In the end even their deaths did not set them free That was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio productionbr br This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world They did it through the power of their musicbr br Ironically near the end Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens br br Peter realizes It doesnt MATTER if were in the box the film He means that it doesnt matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur You need to just let now HAPPEN as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definitionbr br When you cant even tell the difference will being free or not doesnt mattertying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of timebr br I saw this film at a very important time in my life I was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun ie sex like everyone else did But the revelation in Head broke my selfimposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever knowbr br For decades Ive watched Head and wished I could thank Petebr br Was this a good moviebr br Uhh how about likebr br YES,1
The film had many fundamental values of family and love It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story The script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for childrenand was enjoyable and humorous at times There were a few charged symbols to look for The cinematography was acceptable There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing todaywhich quiet frankly is getting a little warn out It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didnt like either but in all it was a good movie,1

For only doing a few movies with his life the Late Great Chris Farley Farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in Tommy Boy David Spade From the lame Police Academy 4 Spade really has done good with his career in films Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch it From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing Tommy Boy Black Sheep Beverley Hills Ninja Almost Heroes Billy Madison and Dirty Work I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time Thank you Chris Farley,1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for its release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it Its like taking a trip to Indiacolorful magical thought provoking Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western life styles and philosophy The characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good Visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through Rajasthan is likedreamlike Sometimes its hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is realthe movie has that same quality Great soundtrack too,1
I had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication And its still not at the top of my list But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary almost stunning and rescue this from being just another tearjerker Carters depiction of an ALS victim is strong perhaps even overdone at times sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performancebr br,1

still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you thinkbr br I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well His name was Mr Krisak To me he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you werent all too keen on If we didnt like Shakespeare then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it Our class room was never a room it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time This was his own indelible way of branding something into our spongelike minds br br I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind like the phone number of a long lost best friend and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix Now if I didnt know better I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr Krisak But giving them the benefit of the doubt well assume it wasnt him But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable br br He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real Show me how you can tell that you are real This got the class spouting off all of the

then But if you look at todays technology now ask yourself what it you were a part of someone elses dreambr br Another brilliant but surreal film this year David Lynchs Mulholland Drive explored similar areas But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to In short this is one film that will literally if you let it blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround youbr br Open your Eyesbr br Tom Cruise plays David Aames a young hot shot righteous full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy his board of governers the Seven Dwarfs think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them br br Early in the film we meet one of Davids gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz David and Julie play a good game both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous committed relationship This is the type of relationship commensurate with Davids other flings hes had in the sexual prime of his life And although both talk a good game we can tell that only one is really telling the truth br br Next we meet Brian Shelby played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smiths good buddy Jason Lee Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again And that is the sweet aint so sweet without the bitter He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or twobr br At Davids huge birthday bash so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday Brian enters with his date Sofia Sorrano played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another And in typical David fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to flirt with Sofia To complicate things Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David David then spends the night with Sofia but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another There is no hanky panky The next day as David is leaving Sofias apartment he is greeted by Julie who offers him a ride and from therewell I think we have all seen the commercialsbr br That is all I will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze There is a subtext of death and possible panacealike curealls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesnt end therebr br Like many movies seem to thrive on today this film has a secret Sixth Sense may have began this craze but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze Regardless of how it originated Vanilla Sky has one of its own surreptitious gut busters And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up something more I can understand To be able to work your mind in the theater to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film All of the ersatz so called Best Pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular They lack substance A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who dont like it dont quite understand it br br This is what film making is supposed to be like This is what a film is supposed to do to you It is supposed to make you feel something Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces This one isntbr br 10 out of 10 The best film of the year I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress Diaz for best supporting Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor Cameron Crowe should there as well None of this may come to pass and that is a shame This is one film that should not be missed br br And on a final note I am quite sure Mr Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question Can you prove you are real Or are we just a figment of someones imagination Are we artificially transplanted for someone elses bemusement This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers And Im sure that is just fine with himbr br Open Your Eyes,1
I would reccomend this film to everyone Not only to the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue but to all filmbuffs Because its sincere moving funny and true Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza who was like Freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that Ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms Because its a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and it was exactly like that Thanks Luciano,1
The best movie about friendship Especially between an AIDs infected person and a normal person This is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used I have seen it 25 times,1
This is an excellent suspenseful murdermystery movie Not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous Ryan Gosling for a couple hours whats not to love Also Sandra Bullock is good in this movie Ive always been a fan of hers I just wish she hadnt decided to be in The Lake House which was horrible but thats another story altogether Obviously since there are thousands of other murderhorror movies out there there are bound to be similarities between them no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made Anyway this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy scary movies its a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie,1
On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear I enjoyed this movie Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob Lexa Doigs character was confusing to understand at first she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart Dean Cains performance was an usual excellent He gets better with every film he does My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob Camilla and the baby It was left for the viewer to decide,1
Wowthis is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends If you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer if you are old enough that isif not a root beer will have to do and watch a couple of episodesits the perfect recipe for happinessbr br The thing I like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing After a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them I think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life Doug is fat but still happy with ithe loves his wife his job and his friends The father in law is the fly in the ointment but hey nothings perfect,1
Ah Ritchies made another gangster film with Statham thought the average fan expecting another SnatchLock Stock expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts but none too hard for me and the lads to swallow after a few beersbr br Ah pay attention you do need to watch this film No cups of tea no extra diet cokes from the counter no keep it running shouts as you nip to the fridge watch the film No laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence and if that floats your boat so be it but sharp solid direction excellent dialogue and great performancesbr br My favourite Big Pussy from The Sopranos always a reliable hood,1
br br I saw The Glacier Fox in the theatre when I was nine years old I bugged my parents to take me back three times I began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but I would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased I understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel Disney etc and shown regularly It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan narrated by a wise old tree The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well It would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to childrens movies today,1
In the 2nd of his Historical Martial Arts films Chiba portrays his real life sensei Mas Oyama The film even recreates Oyamas incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands Oyama did this feat over 50 times in real life Dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic Kyokushinkai techniques Ironically this is one of the rare Sonny Chiba films in which he DOESNT tear out or rip off body parts of opponents A must see for Sonny Chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films,1
A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort The Divorce Of Lady X 1938 It marks the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century English moors And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly wellsuited to screwball comedy it all flows along nicely Oberon is Leslie a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer Logans Olivier hotel suite by way of a nasty English fog preventing travel She does everything possible to irritate himbut in the crazy way films go he falls for her And she falls for him But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberons Lady X thats all she leaves Oliver in a note is thought by Olivier to be a married woman To make matters worse and more amusing Lord Mere Ralph Richardson goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear Larry thinks must be Oberon There is some nice battleofthesexes dialogue and fun exploration of sexual politics You can see that Olivier is not too confident with the comedy but in true Olivier hes a consummate professional and delivers And he handles the screwball twists and turns maybe not with ease but with gusto Oberon was no great shakes as an actress but she was usually competent enough and despite their reputed offscreen dislike of her worked well with Olivier This was filmed in early Technicolour that looks very primitive today everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson but perhaps the print needs cleaning up,1
This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen It does not seek to tell the whole story but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ It is darkly witty playful and seriously faithful to elements of the Jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation Judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine but a grossly mistaken man horribly misguided in his zeal Chris Sarandens Jesus is playful and serious faithful and committedvery human while also divine The final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others,1
True Love I truly enjoyed and LOVED this movie It was fun funny and inspirational I just saw it on DVD How did I miss this one its a winner I mean Flex was That Guy I wanted to marry him This was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off I thought Tangi Miller was the best ever and I was a Felicity head too A fearless woman who only fears her Nana Thank You for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great Tasha Smith was a Blast Aloma Wright was priceless as Nana This cute romantic comedy is A Must See Oh and the new comer Marcus Patrick is worth the surprise ladiesTrue Love Karen,1
I had watched snippets from this as a kid but while I purchased Blue Undergrounds set immediately due to its being a Limited Edition only now did I fit it in my viewing schedule and thats mainly because Bakshis American POP 1981 just turned up on latenight Italian TV see my review of that film below br br Anyway I found the film to be a quite good swordandsorcery animated epic with especially impressivelooking backdrops the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score The plot again wasnt exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed especially interesting is the villainous Icelord Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta depict the girl as wellendowed her bra could be torn off any second and halfnaked to boot her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass Still its clearly an actionoriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving Darkwolf being particularly savage the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains lair inside a cave br br In the long run apart from the aforementioned Frazetta backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like CONAN THE BARBARIAN 1982 and THE BEASTMASTER 1982 but also animated TV series such as BLACKSTAR 198182 and HEMAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE 198385br br As for the accompanying THE MAKING OF FIRE AND ICE TV Mark Bakshi 1982 12br br Vintage featurette on the swordandsorcery animated film which is only available via the washedout VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself It goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of liveaction performances in a studio of segments from the script which would then be traced blended in with the backgrounds and filmed Still having watched several such behindthescenes featurettes on the art of animation on the Disney Tins and the Looney Tunes sets for instance its doesnt make for a very compelling piece,1
I play final fantasy 7 and this movie is EXCELLENT like the game all fans of final fantasy will love this movie br br The music are fantastic and the history is good but the best of this movie is the visual effects are amazing The characters are equal to the game and that detail are good for the fans br br You dont need play the game to like this movie all the people can enjoy the film because the history is some different and is easy to understand I buy the DVD because is EXCELLENT IS 100 ADVISABLE if you dont see this film what you waiting for believe meyou will fascinate like me,1
If you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated youll enjoy Dwar If you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films youll enjoy Dwar Otherwise dont bother I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends They really loved it and that made me feel good After the movie was over all the kidsmy nephews and their friendscould not stop thanking me for taking them to the theaterbr br The CG is good Acting and directing are horrible Storyline is extremely simple But since the half of the audience was kids they were screaming shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have beenbr br Its a good movie to take your kids to but except for the final battle sequence DWar is disappointing I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much,1

This one is a great one Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver Along the way he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates none of whom want him in their class They move out of the barracks when he arrives Ultimately he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a US Navy diver Watch this one Its a great tale of courage and honor As the story unfolds we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time,1

Its true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes And none more so that September 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorismbr br No this documentary didnt set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 911 Rather the filmmakers brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby probation firefighter to join them in an NY firehouse home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7 But their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Centerbr br I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad who informed me of the above Few minutes later he told me there was another and that the WTC was under attack By the time I arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hourbr br The filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action The other camera held by the other brother was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of New Yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhattenbr br Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event Through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save livesbr br We began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures Its not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters Its as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safetybr br Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7,1
I was in my mid teens when I saw this movie and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story It amazes me to learn that Alvina has recently died that Bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years and that both would be in their 50sbr br The Elton John soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion I have seen the movie poster billing it as Deux Enfants QuisAiment which apparently means something like Two Children Who Like Each Otherthe English language distributors were wise to abbreviate the titlebr br Paul the ignored 15yearold son of an English businessman living in Paris meets Michelle an orphan at the zoo The two take what they intend as a daylong holiday to Michelles late fathers rural cottage but end up staying there for a year isolated from the outside world They fall in love Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home After the babys birth the police come to Pauls work place and take him awaybr br Blue Lagoon comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise So sad that Friends has never been released on DVD,1
When Braveheart first came out I was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film When Rob Roy came out I was intrigued and although I enjoyed the film I did not think it was a great film However as time has gone by my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has diminished Braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well The most significant in my view is the unflattering portrayal of Robert the Bruce who was without a doubt Scotlands greatest king Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions I think I am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the beginnings of Mel Gibsons egomania can be seen clearly for the first time In contrast Rob Roy has grown on me over the years Partly because it largely avoids the faults I mind most in Braveheart But also because Rob Roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing,1
A gem of a British capercomedy Poor American schlub Pinky Green Richard Jordan playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one gets out of a British jail and tries to go straight but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his neverreformed criminal friends headed up by a really nasty Ivan David Niven in one of his last roles Pinky resists but the lure of all that money is just too much for him Things unravel and reravel and its all joyous to watch Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career but he never played the same one twice this one is just too lovable to hate Niven never played a slicker bad guy oil all over Two fine actors weve lost that I wish we had back,1
How this has not become a cult film I do not know I think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedybr br Runaway Car attempts to pass itself off as a fastpaced thriller but taking the quality of acting good God its bad the storyline the practicalities of the cars demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh And laugh you will Films are made to entertain us and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a films worth This film is the pinnacle in entertainment I laughed from beginning to end At one point I got short of breath and nearly choked it really is that funny at some points When the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didnt rip the car roof to pieces I was laughing hysterically But when the baby starting swinging around in the air nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree tears were running down my facebr br It also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played Jesus in Madonnas Like A Prayer video He seems to get everywhere,1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made The acting of Charles Buchinski later known as Bronson is simply outstanding This is the crown on the career of director Winner who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece The plot has been copied many times but its never been topped Wildey J Moore the gun manufacturer many times claimed his brands growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3 and rightly so This is not just a movie this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate Although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the USA it has found a huge following in Europe and Asia where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across Europe All in all a true classic,1
Spoilers This movie has its problems but in the end it gets the message across I liked it because it ends the way things really do The nice guy tries and tries gets his heart broken several times but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending It ends the way such things always end or at least always have in my own and friends experiences Anyone who thinks that the ending to this isnt how it really happens as the first comment seemed to believing that the girl would come around realize shes dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesnt care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than I I give it 710 extra points simply because it wasnt afraid to end on a down note give no real resolution just the main character left heartbroken confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before,1

This is not a GREAT movie as tho the cast especially the kids admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with cliché upon cliché Poor family in 50s mid America dying mother alcoholic father 10 children 1 of whom has epilepsy and an awful decision to be made Its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being sickly or naff And little Frank and Warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many times I see it A great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all Only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it Not on a par to Sophies Choice but a good TV movie equivalent,1
This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits When I got Agent Under Fire I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better but now there is a new type of James Bond game This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions the graphics of the game are out of this house It even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M forgive me all if I spell it wrong This game would be own as the greatest James Bond game aroundbr br I give this a 1010,1
The unflappable William Powell He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world He always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him The murders are projects barely human beings I have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit Other than an occasional weeping widow the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists Nothing more There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and Powell is a master at this There is a lot of political incorrectness especially as it relates to the Asian performers This is a little hard to take The cast is great and Curtizs direction is also a consistent asset,1
This is one of my favourite films dating back to my childhood Set in the remote wilderness of Siberia at the turn of the century a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food preying on outlying farms In this atmosphere we are introduced to Avakum a hermit fur trapper who lives out in the wilds as he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris his close and rather only friend in the village who runs a store At Boris request Avakum accompanies his friends arrogant son Ivan on the hunt for the menacing tigers Personalities crash and tempers flare as the older more experienced Avakum criticises Ivans amateur methods an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt On the second day the hunters sight their prey and give chase In a thick wood Ivan wounds one of the tigers which then attacks the hapless man Avakum seeing Ivan tangling with the enraged beast fires but accidently hits Ivan He kills the tiger as it flees The other hunters arrive on the scene suspiciousbr br Back in the village the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan Avakum attempts to leave the village but is confronted by Ivans friends The trapper brushes them off however and speeds off with his dogdrawn sled The young villagers swear after him that theyll come for him if Ivan dies which he later does but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident Old Boris upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village straightens out the gathering lynch mob and goes out after Avakum to find him and set things right And so the main story beginsbr br A simple film it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature mainly Avakums struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness The winter landscape is very well filmed Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell Very sentimental and evocative the main theme reminiscent of Albinonis Adagio Other movements reflect Russian styles as well as a couple of folk music type tunesbr br Unfortunately this film is not available to buy to my knowledge which is rather a shame The copy I own recorded off TV nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating This film is a must see for those who can appreciate it if they can find it 810,1
I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depressionera musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years Yes we are in the economic doldrums or have you been living under a rock and times look bleak But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles In the 30s filmgoing was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom Footlight Parade 1933 was one such film that audiences flocked to While this Lloyd Bacondirected musical doesnt quite capture the social issues of the time as Gold Diggers of 1933 1933 does its still a wonderful showcase of talent We have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece Busby Berkely extravaganza numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me Yes little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her tapping is soso but Busbys magical By A Waterfall whisks her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a dizzying water wonderland Of course Busbys numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough wisecracking nonmusical scenes And Footlight also has James Cagney in at the one of his alltoofew musicals really what couldnt this man do He even gets to take over from the leading man don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot Shanghai Lil who is really little Ruby in Chinagirl wigHe costars with Joan Blondell his adorable adoring secretary who Cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women until the final reel that is Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene,1
This is a novelty in Danish film The mood is not unlike that of Blinkende Lygter also by Anders Thomas Jensen but with a novel touch One difference is fewer characters leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into And what characters The two butchers are perfect Mads Mikkelsen is a dominating deranged parody and Nikolaj Lie Kaas an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two,1
Beforehand Notification Im sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when I saw the preview for this movie I was thinking Finally I have yet to see one movie about popular Africaninfluenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was a Black woman Ive seen an excessive amount of movies where a nonBlack woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it Breakin Breakin 2 Save the Last Dance Step Up but the Black women in the film are almost nonexistent That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop Africaninfluenced dance and breaking was with Blacks and Latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasnt always men who performed it so I felt this movie has been a long time coming However the race does not make the film so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watchbr br Pros I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture I cant recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were Jamaican had believable accents and werent stereotypical with the beanies The steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive Even when the audience was made aware that the main characters sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didnt make the plot stereotypical I was satisfied with the way it was portrayed I LOVED the stepping the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers the trials that the main characters parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with Crabs in a Barrel I respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world They were all just as excellent as the fellas I dont see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered Black filmsbr br Cons Im not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but I question whether theyve been to real step shows Whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers handfeet beats At a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups And then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers hands and feet It was awkward I was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus Stomp the Yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in Stomp the Yard Meagan Good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the Deltas let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately Even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music I know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks couldve played the music in other parts of the filmbr br Im not a Keyshia Cole fan so every time I saw her all I kept thinking was Is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks She looked uncomfortable on screen to me I thought they shouldve used a host like Free or Rocsi instead Deray Davis was funny as usual though Also I groaned when I found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldnt possibly happen anywhere else Hollywood as usual However only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to dobr br I wouldve given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs,1
Excellent writing and wild cast The tech is poor but its obviously very low budget Looks like they didnt cut the negative but had to release on a video output In any case one of the most inventive comedies Ive seen lately The screenwriter in particular is fine,1
When I really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven I had a big list of must see films and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts I remember one of the films on that list was A Chorus Line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come truebr br Of course I lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to watch there I mean take A Chorus Line a stage play turned into film I know its something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something specialbr br Most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places A Chorus Line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie Following a big audition held by recognized choreographer Zach Michael Douglas Richard Atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the jobbr br Everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancers And it all occurs on the stage where Douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go bybr br Like a movie I saw recently A Prairie Home Companion the broadcast of a radio show Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity On or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop Again I dont if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesnt look like it and anyway its a great directing and editing John Bloom work But in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camera With only one setting Ronnie Taylors cinematography finds the way making closeups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of New Yorkbr br In one crucial moment Douglas tells the ones that are left Before we start eliminating youre all terrific and Id like to hire you all but I cant This made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good Its hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrificbr br To tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics by Edward Kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett The book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman which is very touching at times So if its not with a song it will be with a word but in A Chorus Line its impossible not to be movedbr br During one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition Cassie a special dancer played by Alyson Reed takes the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it The words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics,1

I have seen The Running Man several times as I am a Stephen King fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago I didnt know about this website and I didnt realize that the Paul Michael Glaser that was involved with this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grow up watching on Starsky and Hutch television show For me this is a pleasant surprise because I cant tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt The episode where Starsky Kill Starsky almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show What to you expect of a kid at age 12 Now I intentionally look for films and programs involving Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on Im so there Just got to say Happy birthday Paul,1
br br I have to admit to enjoying bad movies I love them I watch all of them Horror especially My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast One of the ones we got at Hollywood Video was this one Zombie Bloodbath This one had a great box so I was expecting less than usualbr br The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the aboveground layers bulldozed and the other underground layers are simply covered up The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave This wakes up some zombiesbr br From this point on its chunkcity The gore effects and action never stop until the end credits rollbr br OK its not great art but this one with its injoke dialogue and overthetop gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening Actually it was one of the best party tapes I have ever had the pleasure of watching And you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people There are hundreds of zombies and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip,1

1904 The North African nation of Morocco is hanging onto a tenuous Independence as the various European powers France Germany Britain Russia Spain and now the United States are vying for influence in the region The Sultan Marc Zuber is a weak puppet his uncle the Bashaw Vladek Sheybal who is being manipulated by the French and Germans is the real power behind the throne Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli Sean Connery the leader of the Rif tribe and the last of the Barbary Pirates who kidnaps an American missionary Eden Pedecaris Candice Bergen and her two children and takes them hostage Back in the US President Theodore Roosevelt Brian Keith threatens to go to war over the issue Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his Big Stick diplomacy though Secretary of State John Hay John Huston is not so confident However the Raisuli has less sinister plans for the Pedecarises who are more than capable of handling themselves in any eventbr br John Miliuss great historical film based VERY loosely off of a true story ie Pedecaris was a middleaged man is a wonderful bit of escapism It has some amazing action scenes a witty wellwritten script a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not overstay its welcome like say Pirates of the Caribbean or the Lord of the Rings movies Its not really an epic film in the strictest sense but its one of the best pure action movies ever madebr br While the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more pertinent today than it was when made As President Roosevelt says America is like a grizzly bear fierce strong but a little blind and reckless at times At the time of the films setting America has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower following their resounding victory in the SpanishAmerican War and Roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove Americas worth In real life it didnt quite work out that way but allegorically it works well While written from a rightwing perspective Miliuss screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing America and its place in the world He admires Roosevelt and his method of big stick diplomacy and correctly recognizes in the words of Roosevelt that while America may be feared and respected theyll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do And there are some scenes like Roosevelts target shooting of European leaders and the almostcomic surprise attack by Marines on the Bashaws palace which show Americas reckless and violent side while others the climactic showdown with the Germans show their heroismbr br The historicalpolitical context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing actionadventure film There are some brilliantly done action scenes such as Raisulis rescue of the Pedecariss from doublecrossing tribesmen which features some of the best swordplay in any film The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the US Marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces And the final battle which combines elements of Lawrence of Arabia and The Wild Bunch while a major historical fantasy a threeway battle between Germans Americans and the Rifs is a superbly staged adrenalinepumping sequencebr br The excellent cast gives some wonderful performances Everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film and it shows Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent but manages to pull off his interesting welldrawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern uncivil warfare Candice Bergen an actress whom Ive never been fond of gives a fine performance as the feisty Eden Pedecaris who is every bit as tough as her captor Brian Keith is an amazingly convincing TR you really feel he must have been like this an athletic blustering yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self The scenes of Roosevelt boxing and targetshooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history and who can forget lines like Why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality John Huston provides solid support as the weary cautious Hay acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous Roosevelt br br Among the fine supporting cast the best are Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere the cynical Ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue and Steve Kanaly as the gungho Marine Captain who cheerfully advocates and carries out Military intervention as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation Other familiar faces such as Vladek Sheybal Nadim Sawalha Roy Jenson Larry Cross Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty also do fine work no matter how small their role Spaghetti Western fans will recognize Antoine SaintJohn A Fistful of Dynamite as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of Raisulis tribesmenbr br The Wind and the Lion is all around a wonderfully done adventure film It has something for everyone wonderful gun and swordplay a lot of humor a tough feisty heroine and her two cute children a nice if unconsummated romance and an interesting if fanciful politicalhistorical context Its not a masterpiece but hey it wasnt trying to be I give The Wind and the Lion a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation,1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm wit and charm At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore She left her parents house and got a job Now Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy They are best friends The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies and TV shows and are constantly quoting them In the first season Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton a very highly rated high school so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents They are happy to give them the money but in exchange Rory has to come have dinner with them every Friday night I highly recommend this show I love it,1
I cant say I enjoyed this as much as The Big Lebowski or Raising Arizona and felt a little slighted but O Brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the Coens brisk twisted sense of creativity The DVD edition contains the featurette and I was interested to find out that the Coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques That surprised me Of course this movie is not the best example and Im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any Oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal br br Though I enjoyed the Coens previous work Ive never been a fan of old westerns or The Dukes of Hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on TNN I guess thats why I didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around Southern folk For all those from the South who are reading this I dont mean to offend ANY of your people Im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like A Bronx Tale When you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature But all apologies aside I found the characters fun and quirky I think John Turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life I find that amazing Tim Blake Nelson was also good Of course George Clooneywho I assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for The Perfect Stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent His performance was good though You can also spot Coen regulars like Holly Hunter in a short but sweet role and John Goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itbr br Though I dont normally dig country music I liked the title song A Man of Constant Sorrow The DVD also contains the music video for that song br br Overall I found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the Coens have shown to us in the past Its a slighter effort but a good one I still suggest you check it out br br My score 7 out of 10,1
Like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on Pearl Harbor every one who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw itand some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile obnoxious repulsive and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bonesbr br Filmed with a closetozero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of The Filthiest People Alive Just how filthy can they be Plenty the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo and I guarantee that you wont want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing itbr br The cast is either wonderful atrocious or atrociously wonderful depending on how you look at it The star of course is Divine and to describe Divine as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup BIG orange hair and BIG expressionsshe is the Charleton Heston of drag and whether she is almost running down a jogger pausing to use the bathroom on some ones front lawn or startling reallife shoppers by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce Danny Mills and the everappalling Edith Massey as members of Divines family and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the whiteslaving babyselling couple who challenge Divines statusbr br It should be pretty obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one and viewers who know director John Waters only through such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be in for a major jolt But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python couldnt imagine it this is the movie for you Just make sure you eat before you see it because you probably wont want to eat afterwardand you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in casebr br Gary F Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer,1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house Its a very positive and happy type of music The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no Buddy Holly didnt give up on what he liked I didnt know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie Ive been to the Surf Ballroom where he last played but didnt give much attention to it until I watched this movie Its an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie,1
Nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s Radiofreccia describes a generation it describes life in a small village near Correggio hometown of Ligabue the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world It reminds of Trainspotting with a bit of Italian touch,1
Id waited for some years before this movie finally got released in England but was in many ways very pleased when I finally saw it There are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting Its not something I have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work This and the constantly gripping and interesting script with a nice sorta Lovecraftian feel to it give the film a real solid backbone Add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner It has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and splattery Also the characters of Marcus the angry bodybuilding transsexual and Daisy his mentally retarded loverplaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times and give a far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent Freudian overtones This is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything Hollywood can produce My only gripe was that I wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole Id really recommend this to serious horror buffs,1
I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever If you are in the mood for a comedy I totally recommend this movie So heres the summary There is this girlNikki who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her fatherAndre whom she hasnt seen for about two years She expects the vacation to be totally boring until she meets this boyBen who is much older than she is So to try to impress him she says that she isnt on vacation with her father but her lover This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end and I highly suggest it So rent it and enjoy,1

With the advent of the IMDb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience Why Because users here who do a search on twotime Academy Award winner Glenda Jackson can find The Return of The Soldier among her credits So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie Fans of AnnMargret can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great Alan Bates Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay Any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the IMDb given all the crossreferencing that goes on here So why isnt this movie out on DVD Dont the Producers realize the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a film And The Return of The Soldier is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered Get with it people,1

Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts unlike many other great Ford films like The Searchers My Darling Clementine The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Grapes of Wrath among others but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction The story is very simple two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California Along the way they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away a group of bank robbers and some Navajos Theres a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail and the film is imbued with fun and beauty The music is absolutely beautiful The scenery again from Monument Valley is as beautiful as it ever was Plus how can you go wrong with James Arness The Wagonmaster might not be one of John Fords better known films but it is nonetheless a mustsee if you get the chance 910,1
A very great moviebr br A big love story Lots of sword fighting Huge battle scenes Heros and villains Real historybr br Few in the West know much Chinese history Chin Zchaundi founded China The country is in fact named after him Some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed This is a historical epic of how he ended the Period of Contending States and unified China He founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization ever sincebr br Chin or the King of Zheng as he was known before he founded the empirewas roughly contemporaneous with Scipio Hannibal and Fabius in the West The parallel Roman world dominance West and East worlds was achieved without a single towering personality like Chin It would not be for another century before the West produced Caesar the nearest comparable Western figurebr br Chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot History only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film The famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be Gong Li is lovely She is the emotional core of the story It all makes for great movie making,1
As a Westerner watching another cultures view and tradition of marriag I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult especially in this modern age Yet this is the case in this Hindi film Told with humor and fresh perspective we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon As said it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night and how they try to forge a bond even though they do not know one another We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment Theres song witty dialog poignant moments blending and comparison of new ways and tradition Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story yet it is still a delight to watch Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived however the overall movie was worth watching,1
This is an interesting movie I think its very humorous although the humor is very black Fulci is good and funny acting himself its a really funny and truly crazy selfportrait of an artist I make horror films If I would make love films noone would buy tickets And its really SEXY movie also Almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girlswomen Maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do moviesart in the first place Its a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind There is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because its Lucio Fulci As a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting Anyway its one of the three best and most complete Fulci films Ive seen the others are House By The Cemetery ZombiHavent seen The Beyond Actually the script is overally to my opinion quite ingenious You could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessivecompulsive disorder fashionable words The character has a compulsive need to confess crimes or bad thoughts Especially crimes he hasnt even DONE And he questions himself all the time What if I HAVE done it What if I want to do it Have I done it Do I want to do it He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts Im sure Fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in his House By The Cemeterymovie for example there is a character named Freudstein This is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie Fulci did I also like the simplicity of the photographypictures in this film Only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism especially towards women I dont quite understand why Is it entertainment Is it art Is it horror Anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre For the others it may be too much,1
I hadnt planned on seeing this movie however I wasnt disappointed when a friend dragged me along Although there are no real surprises here the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budgetbr br If youve seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and theres a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980s Also Ive read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment but I found it refreshingly different from what I had expected from this genrebr br Overall this movie wont change your life but its got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout,1
Although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parents high school life and many people will try to tell you that this movie is WAY outdated and I admit that that was MY first impression but honestlythe lessons that are learned by the heroesheroines are def NOT outdated Who doesnt want to be famous And who doesnt want do be accepted my their peers And the homosexual guyisnt there a whole controversy today about gay marriage blah blah This movie though released in the 80s still addresses some of the biggest issues in todays world This movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste though thus the 810 rating,1
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect but Rififi definitely fits the bill No other heist film has come close to it before or after The plot is simple but engrosses you It never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it You care for all the characters even though they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws Its hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le Stéphanois When the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to Tony his answer and the expression on his face says it all While the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movieand rightfully sothe film actually gets better afterwardThe director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout but instead inserted a great climactic score during Tonys final ride towards his destiny To think that if Dassin an American Director had not been blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was It certainly wouldnt have been as good if it was made as an American film during that time It was absolutely horrible what Dassin had to go through but he did achieve his greatest work because of it to the benefit of all of us Im just cringing at the thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake Most heist films since Rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another Theres no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money Leave the classics alone,1
Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time And SCIII is my favorite one of the seriesbr br The graphics are very well done Much bigger improvement over the choppy polygons in Soul EdgeSoul Blade The characters have facial expressions hair blows in the breeze and they even blinkbr br Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting plots and characters and SCIII is no exception Each character has hisher background story that is detailed and well done My favorite character is Chai Xianghua Shes cute shes funny and shes a strong female character Yeah I know she wears pink and has a boyfriend who she ends up saving BTW but there seems to be more to her than that Xianghua like all the other characters have flaws and upsides to their personalities so no character is perfect not even the good guysbr br The music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series It doesnt sound kitchy the Vampire series nor does it sound like old school porn film soundtrack Mortal Kombat The characters have their own themes and a lot of the themes are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world I dont think there is a song on this soundtrack I dont likebr br Another cool thing about this game is to create your own animelike character Create a Soul You could make himher look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like However if you found a character customization that you like remember to take notes or else you wont remember how you created that character I found myself being very addicted to CaSbr br Overall I think Soul Calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time It has everything I asked for What more could I want,1
Yes I know that this movie is meant as a comedy And the humor is over the top But the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched I cannot say that it will happenbut if we dont take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility I have noticed that some schools arent teaching facts anymore Like historygeographybasic stuff The focus is more on learning practical abilities The theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work In the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with Gatorade in stead of water Wellwe can laugh about it But if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know To me this is a scary notion So now you understand why this subject isnt funny anymore It could be that Mike Judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesnt improve fast Am I taking this movie too seriously Yes of course To each his own fun I loved Mike Judges work Beavis and Butthead and Office space In these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time In Idiocracy I missed this Most of the events are too absurd and as I said earlier very scary I do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie,1
The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its coolness Theres a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robinbr br Theres a new crimefighter on the streets of Gotham She dresses like a bat but shes not a grownup Batgirl And Batman is denying any affiliation with her Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work But the Penguin Bain and the local Mob makes things little more complicatedbr br I didnt have high hopes for this un since being strongly let down but the weak Batman Sub Zero Robin isnt featured so much herebut I was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called Betcha Neva which is featured prominently throughoutbr br Its a shame the DVD isnt so great Dont get me wrong there are some great features the short Chase Me is awesome and a very cool Dolby 51 soundtrack but the movie is presented in Pan and Scan Batman Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1851 but this DVD is presented in 1331 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there IS picture cut off on both sides I find this extremely annoying considering Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen Warner have had to rerelease literally dozens of movies on DVD because people have complained about the lack of Original Aspect Ratio available on some titles Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond mebr br I would give this DVD 55 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 45 Its a shame because widescreen would have completed a great DVD package,1
If you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made this movie would be on a short list along with 1951s Streetcar Named Desire I imagine ill discover some others that qualify but Kramer vs Kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism So its a very satisfying experience on that level just watching the marvelous probing performances of Dustin Hoffman Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular One of the best child performances everbr br But I also find it very satisfying to watch because its such a thoroughly involving story it always makes me forget my own problems It has such excellent narrative drive Once you stick Kramer vs Kramer on and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them And even once you know how things do turn out each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and againbr br Make no mistake Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involvedbr br 1010br br For one of the best scripts born out of conversations between Benton and Hoffman who was going through a divorce at the time ever written executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly Not to mention what a great involving story it is Put simply a perfect film,1
Wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary,1
It has been some years since I saw this but remember it and would like to see it again It kind of became a therapy for me with a personal experience of my ownbr br A thirtyfive year old man laments over a highschool baseball game in which he missed the ball and his team lost He thinks about it 20 years later if only Id hit that ball and how his life would be better because of it Then he gets a chance to find outand gets a little more than he bargained forbr br It reminds me so much of when I was in high school I twice tried out for our drilldance team and didnt make it This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school If you were on it you were all that I didnt try out till my last two years of HS and after the second time I took it really hard Id hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise and that caused me to not make it That was in 1987br br Through the years even now sometimes I think If only I hadnt hit my leg I wouldve never worn those stupid tights Now I dont sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had I made it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past Who knows it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldnt have met my sons fatherbr br I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change Be careful what you wish for,1
Not really a big box office draw but I was pleasently surprisedbr br with this movie James I did some things to Farrah Fawcett Orr br br cowrote and directed this movie about an ordinary average guybr br named Larry Burrows who thinks his life would have beenbr br incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball gamebr br when he was 15 But thanks to mysterious and magical bartenderbr br Mike Larry gets his wish yet soon realizes that his new lifebr br isnt exactly as he hoped it would bebr br I must say this movie really impressed me Critics have givenbr br it mixed and I must say the concept is really interesting andbr br pulled off well Yes it is a little standard but packs enoughbr br funny moments drama and excellent acting to make it reallybr br good James Belushi I think was Oscar worthy for his role Jonbr br Lovitz is perfect and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shine inbr br their roles Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender Itsbr br just a good movie with a good lesson If youve never seen Ibr br highly recommend you check,1

In a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema in terms of capturing those strange elusive moments of unguarded truth In other ways it is undeniably an amateurish unfocused result of junkies selfindulgently fooling around with a camera Ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability thankfully much more so the former than the latter Part of me wants to reward it solely for its absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity but at the same time I cant completely ignore the occasionally downright awful acting and overtly bad production values At first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting or maybe just wrongheadedly innovative but after a while I got used to it which is in the end the true sign of whether a film succeeds on its own terms or not I guess that answer basically sums up my allaround feelings for the film That is despite its inignorable flaws on a whole it does work very well And if nothing else a film like this really shows how false and contrived the fauxdocumentary shakycam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect such as in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger Here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look cool,1
I just love this film it totally rocks Nicolas Cage looks hot and Tommy does not I definitely feel that Fred and Randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause theyre totally cool My favorite part is when he says Peter Piper Picked A Pepper I guess I Did,1
In the first transformation scene what is the music Ive heard it was The Greeks Dont Get No Freeks Is that right I really liked that sound I also liked the Hydes Got Nothing to Hide in the final scenes Truly a doper movie but with many laughs and puns sight gags and slapstick Madam WooWoos place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing She looks much different in the movie were talking about but her maturity didnt hurt her a bit Mark Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some ways Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time,1
Ive seen this movie quite a few times and each time I watch it the quirkier and funnier it becomes Perhaps its the lack of research that went into Nicolas Cages characters punk persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties filmnonetheless its a cute love story with extremely funny unique characters I think its right up there with Fast Times and Weird Science quintessential eighties flicks,1
Im not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made The story takes place in a fictional state but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy A truthful and honest district attorney played by Yves Montand does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow Oswald and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his teambr br The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is though not uninteresting a bit out of place The ending sequence explaining who Icarus really is partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie,1

This movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues Its full of emotion and the direction is done well The storyline progresses very quickly but I guess thats better than having to watch a 3 hour movie This is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy,1
Alexandr Sascha Luzhin John Turturro is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an Italyhosted tournament His brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life Natalia Emily Watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother Vera Geraldine James to scope out possible marriage partners Vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha whom she met on a walk Sascha too is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting But with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of Natalia Oh and can he become the chess champion also This is a lovely film based on a novel by Nabokov The acting is amazing with Watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast James gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well As for the look of the film it could not be better The scenery is of the putyoureyeout variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause Yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate Then too the ending is bittersweet However if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation dont miss this one You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms,1
This Film was one that I have waited to see for some time I was glad to find it has been everything anticipated The writing of this film has been so finely crafted and researched far beyond what is seen by the audience I found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant The film has many stories and characters woven together around this one Character Kilo a Man whom has rose from the streets amidst many woes and become a very powerful criminal After spending some time in Prison Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems Kilo Finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and Political royalty in order to make clear how important a Mans Word is and stands for A war begins as the street is in arms against Lords of wealth and corrupt Powerbr br A build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns This film will leave you riveted I found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a Movie to be ignored Excellent Go Rent It Today,1
In retrospect the 1970s was a golden era for the American cinema as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese This IFC effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentarybr br The amazing body of work that remains is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period The decade was marked by the end of the Viet Nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of Jimmy Carters presidencybr br One thing comes out clear films today dont measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry as a whole has changed dramatically The big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content or integrity as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenuesbr br The other thing that emerges after hearing some of Americas best creative minds speak is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewardsbr br This documentary is a must see for all movie fans,1
Its unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third After the third that was awful its incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas Chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies Interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done,1
Franco proves once again that he is the prince of surreal erotic cinema True much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with Succubus Necronomicon he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work Jerry Van Rooyens splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist Reynaud who may be schizophrenic or may indeed as one mysterious character states be a devil attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema,1
Saw the move while in Paris in May 2006 I was debating between that and mission impossibleI am very glad I choose OSS 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a FRench movie while in France I had a great time would recommend it It is important to have some understanding the French society of Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie cannot wait for the DVD to come out I dont know how some of the jeu De mots puns would be translated in English I ll certainly buy it when it is out PS I saw on BRice de Nice which is a movie starring Dujardin that all kids were talking about in France this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imaginein comparing both movies I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117,1
I saw this recently on a cable channel The movie is great its one of the few musicals I have seen that doesnt shy away from the light and dark It portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor Some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on I didnt know where to look next One day I shall go and see this on the big screen just so that I see whats happening But what really lifts this to another level is Oliver Reeds performance as Bill Sykes Not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else some inner demons He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner he was capable of anything It was almost as if the Sykes character was on the edge of madness just awaiting the trigger I have seen the Robert Newtons Bill Sykes from the 1948 movie and I thought he was just a bad egg but Oliver Reeds performance intimidated me in my own living room,1

The movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography except for a couple of brief special effects reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TVs early years Nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semipsychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his moodswings kills her And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan He wasnt very versatile watching him essay comedy is almost painful But no one was better at wounded idealism On Dangerous Ground or the psychic pain of this movie Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figurebr br Lupinos problem is that shes locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next The suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape Its a nailbiter all the way This is not one of Lupinos many fine soulful parts that she was so good at Instead its a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting Ryans already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him Then when Whiting walks in and finds the attractivelooking Ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality Sensing trouble Ryan abruptly fends her off finesse is not his strong suit Insulted Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work womens work That does it Up to that point hes been courteous and professional with Lupino trying to set himself on a normal path But Whiting has hit his raw nerve Now theres heck to pay as Whiting bounces out the door leaving Lupino to pay the price Its a riveting scene expertly donebr br Anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little blackandwhites in favor of widescreen spectacles Too bad What a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much,1
Ordinarily Anthony Mann made westerns with the big guys James Stewart Gary Cooper Henry Fonda the A list cowboy stars But in this B film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western The main character played by Victor Mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men Not here For once a true mountain man vulgar crude animalistic is the central figure and its something to see giving Mature one of his better later roles The real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston excellent as a selfabsorbed Custer type cavalry commander and James Whitmore the poor mans Spencer Tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him Rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format Good show and underrated movie all around,1
I thoroughly enjoyed this film which in many ways as Hitchcock did on several occasions was a first attempt at a plot which he reshot later in his career Possibly the most amazing thing about it however is how faceless the lead characters are After watching one remembers Murray Alper as the jovial truck driver Vaughan Glasers touching turn as a blind patriot the unforgettable traveling Freak Show and of course Otto Kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain all of whom completely overshadow Bob Cummings as the rather wooden fugitive compare that bridge jump to Harrison Fords similar stunt in Andrew Davis The Fugitive and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards Cummings is never quite believablebr br The other major support player is of course Hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts Many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects My feelings are that with lack of technology to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievementbr br Obviously this film carries an antifascist message made at the time of the Second World War but being a Hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action Well worth checking out especially for the support roles,1
Just two commentsSEVEN years apart Hardly evidence of the films relentless pullingpower As has been mentioned the lowbudget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal Having said that however the thing is not without merit either as entertainment or as a fright outing per sebr br True the plot at its most basic is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR only without much horror More a case of intrigue Gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key momentsbr br Having picked the DVD up for a mere 395 last week at my regular video store I cannot begrudge the expenditure 1095 would be an acceptable price for the film Just dont expect fireworks,1
This Filmfour funded SciFi movie is most definitely a must see While it takes huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise its handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive despite it being basically a rerun of an earlier film Its good to know that films like this are still being made even if they arent getting wide releases and Cypher is refreshing for that reason The plot twists and turns which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cyphers mystery The plot follows Morgan Sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons to him unknown However his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Ritabr br This film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with its apocalyptic imaging of the future This gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type with its only real close affiliate being Kubricks A Clockwork Orange The plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish and more thrilling plot developing You never quite know where you are with the plot which serves in making it all the more intriguing The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui Northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale and does well with his role Lucy Lui is an actress that has a resume that doesnt quite fit her talent but she has a look about her that just fits this moviebr br Cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole if you want an inventive recent SciFi film Cypher is the way to go,1
Any one who has seen Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead Though it wasnt a success in th box office or TV ratings The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in HebrewThough Sarandon didnt have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear What surprised me or startled me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate And dont ever forget that you are a Jew Though that may have not been a racist remarkColin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those daysKeith Michells portrayal of Pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in The Story of Jacob and Joseph and The Story of David But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savalas or Hurd Hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator,1
When I was young I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies but just recently I watched the show Police Sqaud and I think its great Leslie Nielsons awesome Alan North is cool and who the heck is Rex Hamilton But anyways its one goofy showbr br One of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits I think my favorite one is when Norberg not OJ walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame Classicbr br The only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks Cigarette and the person replies Yes I know I think they used it too many times by whateverbr br Good acting good gags great showbr br 710,1
I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between class But for once a TV movie caught my interest More importantly Helen Hunt caught my eye I really wasnt a big fan of hers prior to this film Sure I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets But something about this movie really did it for me I would now see myself as a huge fan This movie comes with high marks fromme Give it a chance it wont let you down,1
I must say out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out It wasnt as epic as MusaThe Warriors and didnt develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas Simple story a elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end You might need to watch it again to get all the connections right And me personallyI loved the end I could watch it over and over again Maybe a little pathetic but a real freedom fighter story People can be killed but not the ideas they stand for,1
This is a movie that plays to everyones emotions We all want a second chance at things Jim Morris got one followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream What a great message and what a great delivery by this movie,1
ZuThe warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic You never would have guessed it was made in 1983 Tsui Harks use of special effects was very creative and inventive He continued doing this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre Legend of Zu is connected to Zuwarriors from magic mountain It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one The plot is a bit hard to follow But to be honest it doesnt matter It is all about the action and adventure I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI Now we knowhe made this movie Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that There is so much happening on the screenyou simply wont believe I think it is a big shame that this movie wasnt shown in theaters here in Holland Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like Superman Returns or Xmen 3 The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor In most of Tsui Harkss movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor Somehow it is missing in this movie Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters Legend of Zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see A true classic,1
One of my favorite shows in the 80s After the first season it started going downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and Ernest Borgnines character go at it with each other The last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season Unfortunately during those days blacks did not last long on television shows Some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than Airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show When it went to USA it was disgusting,1

THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS The Decline of Western Civilizationwhat a great title eh And of coarse a great movie This is the best concert film I have ever seen A close second being the Talking Heads movie Stop Making Sense I first heard of this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992 I looked at the directors name Penelope Spheeris and thought cool name what else has he directed I thought the first name was pronounced like envelope After some time looking in movie guides I came across the critically acclaimed Decline and realized Penelope was a womanmy Mom corrected me I spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver where I currently reside It was worth the wait This captures the LA punk movement very well This is teen angst at its best folks My favourite is the band the Germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because Darby Crash sings so crazy you cannot understand it I laughed when I saw this The band Black Flag live in an abandoned church and the band X are a very intelligent bunch Also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to Slash Magazine about how we do not need to save the whales there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in I became a huge Penelope Spheeris fan after this and saw all her punk moviesDudes was OK and Suburbia is a cult classic I own both of these on VHS She is a true underground film maker and I love her stuff I would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular I was a big Nirvana fan then but alas I saw this in 2002 and by that point I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal MethodFatboy Slim Quite a change of pace I know but what can you do But if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything Much better than 1991 The Year Punk Broke This is a tough movie to track down but if you get your hands on it rent it even if you dont like the music it is an excellent piece of work Now days it might be easier to find with DVDs being so popular By the way Penelope produced a little known Albert Brooks movie called Real Life which I also own Very funny stuff in todays reality TV craptacular Rent DeclineHighly recommended Thanks,1
best movie ever this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter but it was well worth it i dont intend to do a summary of this excellent movie just go see it if you have the chance i think you will either love it or hate it thats the qualities of a real cult movie,1
Fellowes drama about a couples marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interests the wife of the house Watson Wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wifes cheating and deals with the issue I also like Rupert everett a lot in his role as William Bule the man that Watson has the affair with Although i think Emily Watson is a great actress i had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written did not make her too likable i know a cheater is not supposed to be likable but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them The screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama although Fellowes direction was good and the performances were also quite good This film is better than Unfaithful but not a masterpiece by any means IMDB Rating 67 my rating 810,1
An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders Although tragic episodes such as the Highland clearances feature in the stories there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them Its all filmed in Skye so there is a double dose of beauty The mountain scenery is breathtaking and its a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken Im English so I had to read the subtitles but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen nonactors in other words you are watching the real thing people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history The Gaelic community especially on Skye worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic folk history folk music oral culture Scotland British history multiculturalism or social justice should go and see this film,1
My favourite police series of all time turns to a TVfilm Does it work Yes Gee runs for mayor and gets shot The Homicide hall of fame turns up Pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series A lot of flashbacks helps you who hasnt seen the TVseries but it amuses the fans too The last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up And a short appearance from my favourite coroner Juliana Cox This is a good film,1
Ok maybe Posse cant compare to other popular cowboywestern movies But thats because it didnt have the FUNDING those movies had Obviously whenever you want to produce a story such as this one focusing on African American historical involvement and NO servants and mammies are not historical involvement Hollywood isnt going to be too supportive And believe me they werent The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of out of pocket expenses to make Posse just so that the story could be told I think that alone is commendable Posse may not be Oscar material and they dont like Black media too much either but it is a start It is entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy a character most of us are unfamiliar with,1
I truly enjoyed this film Its rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sportsdance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well In this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion Both women deliver warm touching and at times humorous performances The film also touched on a number of topics from racial issues to sexual identity And yet the approach wasnt heavy handed The production values were also top notch for a small budget film I saw this at the Philadelphia Gay Lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time It was a real crowd pleaser Everyone I spoke to seemed to enjoy this film,1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title The Godfather of Gore While Dont Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds and isnt all that gory its certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller and for my money the best film that Fulci ever made Dont Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulcis later films everything about this Giallo is great The plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys Shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own Martelli soon encounters various suspects including a sexy young lady named Patricia a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into thembr br While this film may not feature loads of gore it does have two of Fulcis nastiest sequences to make up for it The nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs Dont Torture a Duckling features an absolutely great Italian cast Barbara Bouchet a personal favourite of mine is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films Tomas Millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of Irene Pappas Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel The cinematography on display is stunning and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene The story plays out slowly and its always interesting as Fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line There isnt a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer but Fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and Dont Torture a Duckling does climax on a high Overall its a shame that Fulci didnt make more films like this Dont Torture a Duckling is his out and out best work and I insist that every Giallo fans sees it,1
Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan an average man who feels God is messing up his life God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways Of course giving someone Gods powers could take a turn for the worse Bruce Almighty is a good comedy Jim Carrey is good as always Morgan Freeman is firstrate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well The jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carreys facial expressions I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God not only that but also as a black man I thought this quite well especially with the brilliant Freeman There are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film 67 out of 10,1
I just watched this film this morning and I found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith Babette gave them another way to look at life not a replacement but an enhancement She shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her I see the story of God in here He sent his only son to man Man could not possibly give anything that would equal that So for our small sacrifice we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it In this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of God Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in its fullest sense The love that Gods son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it Even the film is a metaphor It seems slow in the beginning but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end It was truly a feast,1
Funny Sad Charming These are all words that floated through my head while I was watching this beautiful simple filmbr br It is rare that a movie truly moves me but Shall We Dance accomplished that with grace to spare Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movieviewing history It left me with a quiet sense of exultation but with a small touch of sadness mixed inbr br And the dancing oh yes the dancing Even if you are not a lover of the art or cant put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can It was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show Sugiyamas touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous childlike way And yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting castbr br Beauty Pain Emotion All the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culturebr br,1
The above line sums it up pretty good The best assets of the comics are its visual gags and wordjokes the latter of which are almost impossible to translate which is why the comics are at their best in their original languagebr br Both are quite hard to capture in film which is why those will never be as good as the comics Movies are simply a different medium than comics With that in mind this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comicbr br The word gags are bearable and sometimes even funny Debouze does an Amelie reference I have to mention that I watched the french version If you dont watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles the word jokes will probably suckbr br The slapstick is okay as well its a very simple form of humor and not really funny when youre older than twelve but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks The other visual jokes are the movies saving grace for the older audience as their often quite funnybr br The acting is totally over the top but again thats not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks Only Depardieu and Clavier dont really overact which might be the reason some people think they didnt enjoy their roles I didnt notice a thing On the other hand Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich turn overacting into an artform Its actually fun to watch Again I fear it wouldnt be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbedbr br Overall not a bad movie at all much better than the previous one Its not a classic and it doesnt dethrone The Twelve Tasks of Asterix as my favourite Asterix movie but its still worth seeing The french version that is 710,1
Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western Man With The Gun Tollinger is a professional town tamer as in when a town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it Tollingers latest gig comes by as an accident strolling into town looking for his former fling he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original br br Man With The Gun starts off as an average western toughguy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses What starts off as forgettable and runofthemill ends up dark and charactercentered The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun not one of his very best performances Mitchum still has his classic and effective toughguy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the actionpacked meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and is easily worth ones time,1
My favorite film this year Great characters and plot and the direction and editing was smooth visually beautiful and interesting br br Set in Barcelona the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood but he carried the part perfectly The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate There were two especially noteworthy scenes the climax was truly inspired The film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been cut but it was wonderfully entertaining br br I nearly didnt watch it but did just to see Audrey Tautou Her role although billed second or third was minor and was outshined by several other characters I wish more films like this were made It brought to mind The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club Dont start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 12 way through,1
the film itself is absolutely brilliant its that buzz that rush that makes you just want to go out blow your wages and loose yourself Its what the weekend is all about its our sanitation where we can come together as one and be ourselves without a care in the world The film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on especially with Jip The characters themselves are instantly likable one in particular is obviously dyers character and his views on what Star Wars is really about geniusbr br If ever youve got an hour to kill before going out stick on this youll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence definitely recommend it,1
I didnt expect much when I first saw the DVD cover I mean Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owlbr br Ahbut then the story got underway unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film I was surprised and delighted at this basically true story Made me want to read more about this fascinating character which means the director fulfilled his purpose and the film was a success,1
this is more than a Sat afternoon special Exremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it Catch the cat companionscout for instance It not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book The comic industry as well as the films publicists missed the boat on this One of the least know really great films A great script by John Sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well Probably the best super hero film Ive ever seen Short on special effects but long on believability This ones a keeper I have never seen a DVD of this film but i used to own a VHS version Good hunting,1
This is the best of Shelley Duvalls highquality Faerie Tale Theatre series The ugly stepsisters are broadwayquality comedy relief and Eve Arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a straight Cinderella especially in the garden scene with Matthew Brodericks Prince Charming Jean Stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although Im not sure I liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines Steve Martins comedy relief as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is quintessential Martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the shows flowbr br As is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up With a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after Children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it I found 3 times in one day to be a little too much,1
Let me say from the outset Im not a particular fan of this kind of film but Nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspectivebr br Back in the old days the folks who inhabit Midian would have been called Zombies the undead And according to what Clive Barker has given us certain members of human kind in this Craig Sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that worldbr br Psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Nightbreed He tricks the police into killing Sheffer but Sheffer goes to a graveyard named Midian cemetery where the Nightbreed congregate and live underground br br Sheffer has also left a girl friend Anne Bobby who still has feelings for him even after hes been killed and is now one of the undead She tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind br br Clive Barkers creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans But its plain to see that if humans left them alone the Nightbreed in turn not bother with thembr br Your sympathies are definitely with the Nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and redneck police chief Charles Haid in actionbr br Clive Barkers been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people I can see where that would come in especially since there are a whole lot of people who dont even think of gays as anything human because theyre taught that waybr br Granted Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence but it also does make you think and I do like the way Clive Barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for the Nightbreed creatures,1
I have to admit I am prejudiced about my vote on this film but I have strong reasons as I know some of the true history that was given the Hollywood treatment here Edna Ferbers novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names cant be used In a way this film is all smoke mirrors Even though it was released in 1946 it was filmed shortly after Casablanca Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette br br She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband Today that is a gold digger but in this social era she is desirable the kind of woman who makes all the men want her all the old snooty society types talk of her avoid her while wishing they were her Ingrid is at her best plays this role well br br Some sympathy for Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave New Orleans The snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town br br Gary Cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing Texan BachelorGambler He pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking Flora Robison as Ingrids Maid got nominated for an Oscar as supporting actress in this film Jerry Austin as Cupidor was overlooked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film does it wellbr br When the film moves to Saratoga it depicts accurately how important Saratoga was in that era I like the sequence when Bergman walks to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the sulfur water which everyone considered so healthy then When she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is that she must have more br br The real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in Tunnel New York which is the actual Saratoga Trunk the film title is derived from This battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie J P Morgan The line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country the east coast The references to it are throughout the film are very real There is even some dialog describing Carnagie as a Scot though the reference is vague unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battlebr br The railroad line the railroad tunnel in Tunnel New York zip code 13848 still exist although the film was shot in California The real tunnel is about 1 mile long It is still part of a key freight line today years after this occurred I grew up there Gary Coopers line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right it is still mighty pretty country,1
This is a spectacular production I have seen the show live twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that I was able to perceive only fragments of what was going on The stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located As always this is a thoughtprovoking sensory overload skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras The footage was Masterfully edited one of the best concert DVDs of all times in my opinion I only hope and wish that they will release this on BluRay of HDDVD so that we can relive this extravaganza over and over again,1
This film was adapted from the well known sutra on Journey to the West where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of Buddhabr br Though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend it did however managed to bring in romance and funfilled humorous scenebr br This real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures One of his student the Monkey God managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon locked up in that particular dungeonbr br The monk awoke in a small village where he found Mei Yan the so called ugly serpent daughter who fell in love over him at first sight Though ugly she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him However a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with Mei Yan following the monk Problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worsebr br The rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal but suffice to say this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what Journey to the West and the love obstacles really meanbr br Towards the very end the whole summary could be described with only one word and that is love The monk went to show the Heavenly Gates the Celestial Palace and Buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powersbr br A wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket There would be of course no regrets at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film,1
Excellent endearing film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as father and dadbr br Dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage mom Olympia Dukakis has left himbr br The rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dads thoughts off what has occurred With them away the daughters can play detectivesbr br The story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life what should have been why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of lifebr br We see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl Both men seem to break out of their daily livesbr br The end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity Its never too late to change,1
Beware My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man Harry Horner better known for his set designs Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesnt know it Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over to little avail He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them cant do well because there is something wrong with him He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence which he later forgets br br Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey or in another sense a sadist The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer but it takes Lupino much longer Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to win Ryan over in order to make things work get the job done get on with life But getting on with things isnt in Ryans makeup as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself br br As a study in mental illness the movie isnt too impressive What its superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness with dangerous psychopathology in the mix and its effect on a normal person In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino cant fix Ryan yet we want her to The result is that if one is willing one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside so to speak its melodramatic structurebr br Horner shows us gradually the layout the Lupino house a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home We become familiar with staircase kitchen and pantry and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which ones she cant,1
Cinderella is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics And it really deserves its status Based on the classic fairytale as told by Charles Perrault the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited read the King wants to get the Prince to marry Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her But there is a Fairy Godmother on handbr br The story of Cinderella on its own wouldnt be able to pad out a feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderellas true sidekicks The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis being the stepmothers cat Lucifer Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairytale plot and are for the most part wonderful Admittedly the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball but after this slowdown the film really gets going again and surprisingly since Cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably ends up as one of the most involving Disney storiesbr br The animation and art direction is lovely All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture and Mary Blairs colour styling and concept art she also did concept art and colour styling for Alice in Wonderland Peter Pan The Three Caballeros and many many others manage to wiggle their way on screen The colours and designs are lovely especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and therebr br Overall Cinderella ranks as one of the best Disney fairytales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams really can come true,1
It was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989 as all the elements of its production were made to look 1960s the acting the characterisations the sets and the props all had an aesthetic from an earlier timebr br The film opens to the moments prior to the dropping of the Abomb on Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family a young woman Yasuko who lives with her aunt and uncle Even in black and white and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards but emotive and effective nonetheless the depictions of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite horrific Family members become unrecognisable to each other others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shockbr br The title refers to rainfall that fell soon after the bomb which was mixed with radioactive ash and in which Yasuko is caught Rumors of Yasukos being in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect her marriage prospects and it is later learnt that the black rain is indeed causing sicknesses The film is concerned not just with the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese but on the social and psychological damage that was wroughtbr br I found the film compassionate and a fascinating journey into a unique culture While the film is primarily concerned with the pain felt by one family the films gentle political message is relevant today and probably for all time wars have horrific consequences and should not be entered into unless absolutely necessary It is said that history repeats itself and the current leaders of the Coalition of the Willing have learned nothing While atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945 other deadly aftereffects have This film is compelling viewing,1
This is a very funny movie easy to watch that entertains you almost all the time The work of the Director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark The movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon but the jokes and comedy are of Argentinian sort The twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and has to go with detective Diaz played by Luque on his assignments while he also assist him Diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him Some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide understandable and laughable anywhere Is very good overall it would deserved an 8 but I rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end On a personal remark I must add that is a bravo for Argentinian Filmmakers considering the little good is coming lately,1
Musically speaking Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another pluperfect musical after Top Hat if that was possible Although in this case like that Jerome Kern confection Roberta that they were in Follow the Fleet retained Randolph Scott with another singer this time Harriet Hilliardbr br Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is an exvaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers his former partner But now the two are on shore leave Fred and Ginger take up right where they left off and Randy accidentally meets Gingers dowdy sister Harriet who blossoms into a real beauty But Randys a typical love em and leave em sailor br br Again Irving Berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production Ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with Let Yourself Go which she and Fred later dance to But the real hit of the show is Lets Face the Music and Dance which is a number done at a Navy show Sung first by Astaire and later danced to by the pair Lets Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen Their dancing on this one is absolute magicbr br Im sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was But they will know immediately when I mention her in conjunction with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson Thats right Ozzie and Harriet Its something of a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Rickys mom on television Then again she didnt even keep her own name br br Neither Ozzie or Harriet sang on television Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer but Harriet could really carry a tune She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Are Here But Where Are You both with real feeling and class I recommend you see Follow the Fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today,1
I can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully I know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten late 20s style but 1932 movie which should probably be referred to as Indecent as that is the name on the main titlesbr br Myrna Loy best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles shows herself to be miscast in all of them She was a true dramatic actress something that I did not know before watching this film which predates all of her famous roles She is exciting and moving here two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined William Powell Im still rather in shock over how good she wasbr br Becky Sharp 1935 the first threestrip Technicolor feature is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation It is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die You cannot take my word for it you must see it,1
Im always surprised about how many times youll see something about World War 2 on the German national television You would think they dont like to open old wounds but there isnt a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war Perhaps its a way of dealing with their past I dont know but you sure cant blame them of ignoring what happened And it has to be said most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about Der Untergang or The Downfall as you might now it which are also very realisticbr br One of those movies is Rosenstrasse It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the USA at the present day After Hannahs father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasnt been very religious before She doesnt know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mothers troubled childhood Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mothers pastbr br The fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising For as far as I know there hasnt been another movie that deals with this subject For those who didnt know this yet Being married to a socalled pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they werent immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrassebr br The acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didnt really do it for me and thats exactly the only part that youll get to see in the trailer Perhaps its just me but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day At least of the part that is situated in the USA because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mothers past definitely worksbr br If you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War and if you arent necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see This isnt a movie in which youll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of I give it an 810,1
This incredibly formulaic flick from the Walker Texas Ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie In addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the getgo However its a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains Thats all it was meant to do and it does so The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isnt half bad The acting is also decent which isnt much of a surprise because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal If youre a fan of the genre and of Walker Texas Ranger you will definitely love this If not then dont waste your time 810,1
Karen Sarah Michelle Gellar an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semicatatonic woman Emma Grace Zabriskie after her previous caretaker Yoko Yoko Maki disappears Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emmas home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goesbr br Maybe its a delayed influence from the success of M Night Shyamalans films but slowerpaced understated horror films are a recent trend In some cases such as Hide and Seek 2005 the approach works remarkably well and in others such as White Noise 2005 the pacing tends to kill the film I didnt like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek but this is still a very good filmit earns a 9 out of 10 from mebr br The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however One it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with JuOn 2000 in particular its extremely close to the first half of JuOn The Grudge aka JuOn 3 from 2003 Two as with many Japanese horror films the slower pacing here isnt so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmarebr br Director Takashi Shimizu also the director of the five Japanese entries in the JuOn series to date the fifth is currently in production and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewersscares How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to filmmaking although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the JuOn series Traditionally American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster A more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isnt yet accepted by the mainstream in the USbr br However even if youre not used to it its worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot This is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters which is done better here than the more episodic JuOn 3 good cinematography subtle production design touches check out Gellars clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emmas house when Gellar first approaches and beautifully effective horror materialbr br Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture its interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary childrenbr br I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mysterythriller territory with a heres what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a 10 out of 10br br Now that Ive said all of the above let me finish with a minirant Its not that Im antiremake but it is ridiculous that US distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption The original versions of these films should just be playing in US theaters in wide release There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for nonwhite or foreign actors Yes The Grudge is a fine film but ultimately Id rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror filmsnot just Japanese but also Indian Spanish Chinese etcat my multiplex In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more costeffective to do this as 1 you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and 2 you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions,1

This is a great small film I say small because it doesnt have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a John Woo film Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three bad guys John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days The film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machineinstead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens Wonderful ending very positive I never read the Elmore Leonard book but it cant be much different from the film because it FEELS like Im watching an Elmore Leonard movie,1

This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies It is virtually flawless The writing acting production design humor and pathos are all wonderful Even the music from Dean Martin to La Boheme is captivating and delightfulbr br Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage to the many supporting roles Olympia Dukakis Vincent Gardenia John Mahoney Danny Aiello even grandpa with his dog pack Each of these performers plus Norman Jewison as Director performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work For several of the actors this was an early major exposure in film so the casting is also exceptional and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this filmbr br Ive seen this film several times all the way through which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially More tellingly I realized some years ago that whenever I channelsurfed my way into a scene from this film any scene the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted There are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters where Cage tells his tale of woe Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera amidst the splendor generated by his goldmine plumbing business Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with coworkers Dont sht where you eat Danny Aiello at his dying mothers bedside Nicolas Cage taking Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background br br There are of course many great romantic comedies among them Sabrina both versions but especially the Audrey HepburnHumphrey BogartWilliam Holden original When Harry Met Sally The Apartmentbr br None quite equals Moonstruck,1
In many ways the filmic career of independent filmmaking legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock the consummate studio director Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately Cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally Hitchcocks tales were always plotfirst narratives with the human element put in the background Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films If some things did not make much sense logically so be itbr br One can see this even from his very first film 1959s Shadows filmed with a 16mm handheld camera on a shoe string budget of about 40000 in Manhattan with Cassavetes acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film The story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling Manhattanites Benny Ben Carruthers a trumpeter and no account Hugh Hugh Hurd a washed up singer and Lelia Lelia Goldoni the younger sister of both The films three main arcs deal with Hughs failures as a nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager Rupert Rupert Crosse Bennys perambulations in an about Manhattan with his two no account pals and Lelias lovelife first with a white boy Tony Anthony Ray who does not realize lightskinned Lelias race even after bedding her then with stiff and proper Davey Davey Jones who may be a misogynistbr br In the first arc nothing much happens except darkskinned Hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts He dreams of making it big in New York or even Paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows hes a marginal talent at best That Rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work But this is the least important of the three arcs While this film is better overall than say Martin Scorseses first film a decade later Whos That Knocking At My Door another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments actingwise nor cinematographically that that film has It also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era Manhattan exteriors at ground level is a gem to relive While Shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film Parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willynilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle All in all its a very sloppy job especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as Cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working stylebr br The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as culturally significant This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote Ive never seen an exploding helicopter Ive never seen anybody go and blow somebodys head off So why should I make films about them But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way Ive seen people withdraw Ive seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and Ive myself done all these things So I can understand them What we are saying is so gentle Its gentleness We have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems That this film is culturally significant is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being artistically significant It is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives,1
This movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark and continues it throughout the movie I cannot recall a scene where i didnt turn to look at people laughing with me he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressedbr br The comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular As you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 79 on IMDb i think it should be in 250 Lets put it this way i havent seen this funny of a movie since American pie or the original vacation see it if you want a laugh I give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about IMDb great movie site,1

The movie seemed a little slow at first But it picked up speed and got right to the point It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget I enjoyed it It is very close to reality as any movie about the Atomic Bombs that were to be dropped on Japan I have recommended it to friends I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz,1
My rating refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting When the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side Starting around Season 5 the show took a different focus still good but differentbr br The series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the Stargate The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie Stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egyptbr br The episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great scifi movies of their own What happens next was always unpredictablebr br The characters on which the show rests are also welldefined and brilliantly performed Their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor They are simply fun to watchbr br Starting somewhere around Season 5 the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the Goauld then the Ori The plots become more complex a lot more politicalstrategic oriented and interdependent The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in naturebr br One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes They are simply cantmiss shows They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasonsbr br If you are a scifi fan watch a few episodes of the first 4 Seasons and youll likely be hooked If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to,1

Although i dont like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago I still think it is one of the best comingofage movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch I saw the opening titles of that movie and theni was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy fantasizing about kissing his dream girl no offense but if that was an American movie you would certainly seeat a certain point mainly climax the shy boy making love to his girl and i really cant grasp this contradicting concepts till nowi have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memoriesThanks,1
Late night on BBC1 was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporaryset Irish film so I stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end I have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress Kelly Reilly who is stunning to look atbr br This is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off It should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you dont know why youre laughing for me Martin Scorseses After Hours 1985 is the best example Dead Bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness I didnt spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so I was suitably surprisedbr br As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003 it all seems rather worthy it doesnt look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back The script couldve been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good Im glad I watched it flaws and all tho I dont think I learnt much about Ireland today especially their policing methods,1

This film was on last week and although at that time of the day around 6pm the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on Mexican TV I couldnt switch the TV off The story about Madelene Moore really touches you She doesnt come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed This film really leaves you thinking And i think that basically due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson I had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting Compliments to Brooke I hope to see her in another film soon,1
I agree with the other comments I saw this movie years ago Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy The ribaldry is unsurpassed If this comes out on video I will definitely buy it,1
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it despite the lack of excitement in the plot The acting was very good by everyone involved Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughters condition Yet in the process she has neglected her older sister who is more interested in playing with her savantsyndrome sibling and living in a world of escapismbr br The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles Christopher Lloyd in a very understated role shows us why he has such versatility He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research yet starved for a meaningful relationship He and Madigan connect very well in their scenes together yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship Their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant an acting lesson for aspiring performersbr br And in a small role Fred Savage is fun to watchbr br You can tell why this movie was based on a play its probably very good on stage On screen its not particularly exciting but its nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties,1
Still the definitive program about the Second World War The World At War isnt just long but also very informative The series contains 26 episodes each episode lasts for about 45 min and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war Most episodes are about the war in Europe and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa Burma the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany Great Britain United States and Soviet Union There is one episode thats dedicated to the Holocaust The series starts off with the episode A New Germany 19331939 and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war The series ends with the episode Remember the wars influence in a postwar world Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series Each episode is like a minifilm The footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together In addition some of the footage is in color The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertainingbr br The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television UK Commissioned in 1969 it took four years to produce such was the depth of its research The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns including eyewitness accounts by civilians enlisted men officers and politicians amongst them Albert Speer Karl Donitz Jimmy Stewart Bill Mauldin Curtis LeMay Lord Mountbatten Alger Hiss Toshikazu Kase Arthur Harris Charles Sweeney Paul Tibbets Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose Jeremy Isaacs says in The Making of The World at War that he sought to interview not necessarily the surviving big names but their aides and assistants The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed according to Isaacs was Heinrich Himmlers adjutant Karl Wolff The latter admitted to witnessing a largescale execution in Himmlers presencebr br The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 voted for by industry professionals The World at War ranked 19th The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other Ive seen some of them several times There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer One is called The Great War 1964 thats about World War I The other is called Cold War 1998 thats about the Cold War obviously,1
I have seen The Sea Within today and I loved it The actors of the movie are wonderful specially Javier Bardem of course but I thought that Belén Rueda would have a better role Lola Dueñas Clara Segura and specially Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations And I cannot forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau brother and father of the protagonistbr br There are two technical aspects I loved very much Aguirresarobes photography and the score by Amenábar himself I liked the song Negra sombra Dark Shadow by Luz Casal with music of Carlos Núñezbr br In short I think that the Spanish Academy should choose The Sea Within in order to compete in the Oscar Awards I liked other Spanish productions such as Almodóvars Bad Education but Amenábars film is much better than them The Sea Within deserves all the awards,1
Im not a huge fan of Lucio Fulcis films Most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as secondrate Dario Argento imitations With the exception of the entertaining Zombi which was a George Romero imitation I didnt really enjoy them I know Italian horror often disregards the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards This is why Dont Torture a Duckling surprised me Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery Its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously rivaled by Dario Argentos entries into the genre And unlike Fulcis previous giallo A Lizard in a Womans Skin this never dragsbr br Fulcis direction here is quite good He keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewers interest throughout Also the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience Plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence Overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story The acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s Italian exploitation cinema Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool throughout The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan whose performance is just far too overthetop Its the only laughable aspect of the film Dont Torture a Duckling definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole 810,1

ROCK STAR 2001 out of fourbr br By Blake Frenchbr br Rock Star is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it We have seen all this before in better movies but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere The script by CrazyBeautiful director John Stockwell portrays the hardcore universe with memorable imagesit doesnt explain what it is about it shows usbr br Rock Star originally titled Metal God stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris Izzy Cole a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group Steel Dragon Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution instead of writing his own songs he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon and only in the exact way they perform them His group becomes irritated with Chris obsessions and gives him the bootbr br This devastates Chris as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend Emily Jennifer Aniston from TVs Friends He then receives a phone call Its the Steel Dragon band They have seen Chris tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer In an instant Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardomfrom the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star Unfortunately its not as rewarding as he expectedbr br A true story inspired the Rock Star concept An Ohio supply salesman Tim Ripper Owens really did replace Rob Halford the lead singer in Judas Priest after initially singing for a tribute band The rest of the film is probably fiction although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star It explores the aspects of touring personality differences the danger of drug abuse and violence struggling relationships sexual freedom dishonesty and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high br br I have seen all of Mark Wahlbergs movies and this is the first that has earned my affection Wahlberg a former singermodel has made movies like Fear Boogie Nights Three Kings and most recently Tim Burtons lacking remake Planet of the Apes I am starting to admire the young actor more and more Although he has not performed in many successful films he has taken many chances and done a variety of roles Rock Star is his best film to date I cant think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Coles struggles and aspirations Wahlberg truly makes Rock Star rock br br Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well She creates a chemistryrich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation Its tragic of what happens to their relationship We care about these characters a great deal br br During the film concert scenes director Stephen Herek who also directed Holy Man and the live action version of 101 Dalmatians creates a gripping atmosphere He captures the scenes with an intense urgency and a raw unmistakable energy The musical numbers provide the film with the best most involving scenes br br Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout At the threequarters mark he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it In Almost Famous a much better film about rock and roll there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes Here it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passionbr br The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination The filmmakers might as well stop everything appear on screen and say now audience the moral of the story is We understand the theme but its too instantaneous The personal discovery for Chris must be gradualbr br Fortunately all of this happens in the last twentyfive minutes of the film hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eightyfive minutes of a reasonably good feature Rock Star is not a great moviesee Almost Famous if you want a remarkable film about rock and rollbut for Marky Mark its a turning point in his career br br,1
Yes it feels and for the most part plays like an after school special for a slightly more adult audience alright maybe a teen audience But add in Bill Murray already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent a nice supporting cast and an unexpected sweetness about growing up and remembering those great or not so great days at summer camp and you get a heartwarming funny sleeper hitbr br It does get a little too smarmy for its own good but that is also one of its charms When you hear the title Meatballs and see the poster you expect a teenage sex romp but what you get is a sentamental yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp The sentamentality and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of A Christmas Story which I also love The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated The only movie Ive seen that comes close is Indian Summer which I like almost as much as Meatballs and also stars Matt Craven Lets hope he completes the trilogy Maybe he could come back for Return of the Meatballs and bring some dignity back to the franchise Meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classicbr br Meatballs is easily on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time not really guilty either Its a wonderful little film that always makes me smile,1
I think this show is screamingly funny Its not for every taste and Im not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that dont get it Im sure theyre wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength But if you like it you REALLY like it Sarah plays a selfinfatuated loser named Sarah Silverman who often finds her self in Homerian predicaments thats Homerian as in Homerian Simpsonianbr br I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief gig on Saturday Night Live in the early 90s I liked her immediately then and I go out of my way to check out anything shes donebr br This show is chokeonyourfoodandwetyourpants funny Therefore I always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers Check it out,1

The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece The first sequel Jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though its still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still hes managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima aka Scorpion and this time shes out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back After escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison But Scorpion doesnt like spending time behind bars and its not long before shes back to doing what she does bestbr br The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail From there however the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films Thats not to say that there isnt still plenty of action Scorpion still spends a lot of time in revenge mode and the film isnt exactly short on general sleaze Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and its another understated almost wordless performance Her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film Theres a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point Overall I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality not as great as the original and slightly better than the second,1
Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family moves in as the father have got a new job in a computer company there But no paradise would be complete without its snake Strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband as it certainly holds secrets The father is not a joiner but pressure is on him to join as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members Robert Urichs good guy part is a bit tepid but Joanna Cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles Suspenseful and wellmade chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chairperson Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit part as a valet The movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for I have seen this movie quite a few times,1
Neil Simons THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays Felix Unger and Oscar Madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose Simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as THE NEW ODD COUPLE with female roommates He made it a mixed couple a woman with her daughter and a man in THE GOODBYE GIRLS He also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with THE SUNSHINE BOYS a Broadway hit starring Jack Alberson and Sam Levine as Al Lewis and Willie Clark the aged semiretired Vaudevillians Here the apartment problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who cant stand each other The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau as Willie and George Burns as Albr br In actuality Al probably does not think totally badly of Willie Willie is pathological on the subject of Al First Al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing Willie with his index finger on stage Secondly Al retired when his wife died Willie was not ready to retire and has been forcing his nephew and agent Ben Richard Benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials But Willie cant remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercialbr br Ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy He does bring Al to see Willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal On top of that Willie is insisting on changes minor ones but they throw off Al such as saying ENTER when Al knocks on the door The initial rehearsal is a failure but Ben manages to get them to the taping of the show The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring Als neckbr br The three leads Matthau Burns and Benjamin do very well with the oneliners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter example Chest painsIm getting chest pains Uncle Willie Every Thursday I come here and get chest pains So come on Fridays Benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although Matthaus rough outer shell makes it difficult he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville Matthau has a little better grasp on reality at first than Burns who seems senile by his repeating himself but in actuality Matthaus sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly Burns is not senile he takes things slowly But he seems far happier in accepting his retirementbr br I call this a final Voyage of Discovery for our modern Lewis and Clark Al and Willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought Even the irascible Willie admits that Al may be to him a pain in the ass but he was a funny manbr br Burns was not the original choice for the part of Al Lewis supposedly Dale of the team Smith and Dale Jack Benny was Benny probably would have done a good job but illhealth forced him out he died in 1975 Burns whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator turned in such a fine performance that he got the Oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD OH GOD YOU DEVIL and GOING IN STYLE He died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife Gracie Allan,1
Excellent movie in many aspects Vicente Aranda has succeeded in depicting the time 1830 with meticulous care The light the places the feeling are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie And along with it in opposite to what happened to Mad Love Juana la Loca a rather episodic historical movie all of this beautiful photography music clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible waybr br Concerning the actors Paz Vega as Carmen is outstanding liar seductive agressive totally sexual so beautiful Carmen Sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for Carmen but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie I recommend it to everyone the best spanish movie of the year,1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinemaphotography and performances I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh the lead character I remember a minibiography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it Apparently she was a Holocaust refugee discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty She died very young and under tragic circumstances Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film Like other neoBiblical films of the 1940s and 50s The Egyptian reflects the morals and values of that time but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told,1
The folks at Aardman have done a cool cute and wild adaptation of their short films of Wallace and Gromit to feature length as the man and his dog inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence or practicality for the latter In this case theyve invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet English village In particular for Mrs Tottington or Totty for those who are intimate much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle Wallace and Gromit seem to have success with their machine but Wallace has a mixup a machine hes made to make more food suddenly crisscrosses himself with a rabbit the curse is on br br A lot of this is about as much lighthearted fun that a kids movie could ask for but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick Looney Tunes which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville Granted the Aardman guys Nick Park and Steve Box have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material Its never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny hoho not funny haha side a tired criticism but Ill say it Curse of the WereRabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition the Golden Bullet story is a doozy Park and Box and company never lose sight of glee in the materialbr br Its fuzzy and warmhearted and completely offthewall for the kids even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets such as the truck Wallace and Gromit drive around in and for adults theres little barbs of funky absurdist tones in the midst of a classic English farce Only and Im probably a minority opinion here when compared to Chicken Run its almost a little slight a work theres less any plot than there is a series of running gags and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese and horrible men with egos in their guns like the Fiennes voiced Quartermaine But when it strikes best its one of the most entertaining films of 2005 It gives me a big goofy smile anytime its on TV,1

This show was not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw all too true to life manner When one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once this is television in its highest form The acting was phenomenal The writing was exceptional Not only did the show portray race relations in a straightforward manner that seems unmatched by any other television series but its ability to depict this subject matter as it existed in the 1960s alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twentyfirst century powerfully demonstrates the ways we have changed and sadly the many more ways we have not,1

If youre a TRexMarc Bolan fan I recommend you check this out It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that arent part of the concert but fun to watch leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people and when the concert is shown a talented musician both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls Watching him in concert you would never know that being a rock star is a job but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances True there are a few songs missing that I would like to have seen on there but like any album it cant have everything I just bought this in 2006 but if I would have know it came out in 1972 I would have definitely bought it years ago Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash,1
I was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie I thought the writer Sue Smith very clearly summarised what the film was about However the movie really didnt need explanation I thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring A movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from parental figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace lifes possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured I enjoyed it much more than the muchhyped Somersault I also think Mandy62 was a bit unkind to Hugo Weaving As a bloke about his vintage I should look so good I agree that many Australian films have been lacklustre recently but Peaches delivers the goods Im glad I saw it,1
The Chipmunk Adventure is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980s Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been of some interest to me since they were what really got me into rock and roll Neither one of the Chipmunks has any bad traits Alvins really the star and has all the cool looks Theodore is the lovable sensitive one Then theres Simon my personal favorite the smart one who is often a party pooper I also like the Chipettes a lot Theres Brittany who like Alvin is one who is always trying to be so popular Then theres Eleanor who like Theodore is sweet sensitive and loves food Janette is the only Chipette who is not much like her counterpart shes very naive and really clumsybr br In the Chipmunks very first fulllength movie David Seville is going on a business trip to Europe and hes leaving the boys with Miss Miller while hes gone While playing an arcade game Alvin loses against Brittany and then says that if he had the money hed race Brittany around the world for real Unbeknownest to the kids a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister Claudia who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash overheard this conversation and said that theyd let them race around the world for 100000 Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the racebr br This adventurous movie has a lot of great songs Off to See the World made for an appropriate theme song for the movie Then there is Getting Lucky one of my favorite songs in the movie My Mother is most likely the sappiest song in the movie but it always makes me cry Wooly Bully is the only cover song used in the movie the rest were completely original Then of course theres The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll which in my opinion has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie historybr br I used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of it died I still watch the movie though This is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time Itll give you an idea of what kind of stuff youd expect out of world travel Definitely one of my childhood movies and one that Id recommend to 80s fans and Alvin the Chipmunks fans,1

Before seeing this I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated Emmanuelle series starring Sylvia Kristel It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be It actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed What makes Yellow Emanuelle so good is its leading heroine the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee She plays her character Emy Wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her Emy Wong is a muchrespected doctor statuesque with a regal quality She comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced Emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage It is simply how it is done in her world However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works Emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her Western man But only after a very long courtship as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman Her pilot George is a good guy and promises to marry Emy so that she doesnt lose her respectability and place in her rigid society Neither one counts on a third party one Ilona Staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her Her place in society is gone she has been debased The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute Classic drama I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama One would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much And when there is it is totally nonexploitative and very artsy and softcore If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle with Sylvia Kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice Her father shows George and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees Totally unexpected After catching it on late night cable TV years ago I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer More sex No more melodrama For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease I actually preferred the cable version better I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70s soundtrack While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special I recommend it to thoughtful viewers who dont need sex and violence to maintain their interest,1

SPOILERS SPOILERS Released in 1956and considered quite racy at the time Douglas Sirks over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing The plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional Texas family that includes big brother Kyle who is insecure weak wounded very alcoholic played by Robert Stack in a very touching vulneable performance and his sluty sister Marylee played in an extreme manner by Dorothy Malone Ms Malones performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes which she uses to show us her emotions which mostly consist of lust for Rock Hudson and jealousy for Lauren Bacall Malone is the only actress Ive ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first Now dont get me wrong her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950s But it is also terrible because as likeable and attractive as Malone isshes not a very good actress and shes not capable of subtly or shading Her performace is of one note She does get to do a wicked Mamboand in a great montage as unloving daddy played by the always good Robert Keith falls to his death climbing a staircase Sirk mixes it up with an almost mad Malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses Stackwho should have won an Oscar Malone who won the award but shouldnt have are the real stars of the film the ones who set all the hysteria both sexual otherwise in motion while the real stars of the film Hudson Bacall fade to grey brownwhich are the colors that they are mainly costumed in Hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood best friend of Stacks and the stalked love interest of Malones who moans groans over Rock through most of the film But Hudson wants no part of herand instead is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack No one is very happy no one is happy for very long The StackBacall marriage falls apart big time after a year and Stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and cant give Bacall a baby to prove that hes a man Sirk who was a very intelligent man and had a long fascinating career both in films and theatre in Germany ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid 1950s with a series of intense vividly colored womens movies or melodramas Although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source materialin Sirks hands they became masterpieces of the genre Sirk had a wonderful sense of color design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations lighting make believe shadows and lots of mirroed reflections In Written the characters are always peeking out of windows listening at doors or sneaking around So in the end after much violence an accidental murder a miscarriage more Sirk ends the movie with a final startling scene of a reborn and reformed Malone in a mantailored suit sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell,1
An interesting movie with Jordana Brewster as a young woman who travels to Europe in an attempt to find out what became of her older sister Cameron Diaz who mysteriously died years earlier Brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting such as having her amazinly find and start a romance with her dead sisters much older boyfriend Christopher Eccleston Still mostly good GRADE B,1
Duck_of_Death needs to watch this film again as his major criticism is completely baseless The film never once forgot about the time delay and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places The crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didnt obey the time delay rulesbr br One thing I did think was a bit farfetched was the amount of risk involved would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours I doubt it Would a manned space ship go into a stars corona I doubt it Would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation I doubt it Also the ship seemed overly sturdy Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down I doubt it Would it survive being hit by comet debris I doubt it I think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much But allinall the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects good editing and production and some good acting especially by the actors portraying the ships commander and the Russian cosmonaut,1
I dont remember this film getting a cinema release over here I only saw it when it came onto cable The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines Specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an offworld community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feelsbr br Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space and would have been happy if it wasbr br Im certainly happy it wasnt Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple The scene where hes sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slowmo replays detracts from the momentbr br This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner Alien Silent running Logans run or THX1138 were however it is unfortunately the nearest Ive seen to it in a long timebr br He changes in the movie to a believable degree he doesnt crack Arnie one liners he doesnt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy endingbr br Thats why this film didnt do well It didnt follow formula and among a 1825 year old target American audience thats unforgivable as it was wasnt what they expected to seebr br Fear and disciplinebr br Always,1
This was the worst movie Ive ever seen yet it was also the best movie Sci Fi original movies are supposed to be bad thats what makes them fun The line I like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever Also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream I can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this Space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet Best idea ever In fact in fits the complete Sci Fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible actingbr br So go watch this movie but dont buy it,1
I had heard interesting critics on this movie I believed it was a love story but I wasnt sure what was the plot about So when I finally saw it I found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the excon Isabel Isabel Ampudia and the junkie Rufo Sebastián Haro So a love story but not probably what I was expectingbr br The movie is focused on Isabel as she struggles to get back into society She doesnt want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go So while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across Rufo an old acquittance of her which while she was in had become a junkie and lives on the streets Not having where to go and without money or feasible source of income she decides to join Rufo on his residence a covered area on a lonely streetbr br The story by itself is moving It explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the moviebr br Definitely the movie is worth watching Sebastián Haro is splendid in his role of the junkie A person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street scum Just depending whom deals him with I believe his rolebr br On the other hand I dont quite believe the role of Isabel Ampudia Although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes she is not capable to make me believe it She is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situationbr br The movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation It is a enjoyable movie But the feeling I get when the movie ends is that Isabel with the way of thinking and acting she has would never have arrived to that situation Her role partly because of the script partly because of the acting is difficult to believebr br I specially like the ending and because of it I have raised my rating one or two points I liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as lovebr br Summarizing an interesting movie but it lacked some punch to be a total must see,1
First of all nothing will ever compare to the original movie but for gosh sakes theyre not trying to It is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara I for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie Just view this movie as an extension of the original and dont think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you will enjoy it a lot They really captured the spoiled selfishness of Scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from Rhett that he is clearly still in love with Scarlett The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on TV I always wanted them to have other children after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly br br Lore60,1
I dont hand out ten star ratings easily A movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that Furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hoursbr br From the moment that the opening title appeared I knew we were in for a ride Paul Greengrass has done it again Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera However for me that last one was never a problem I think it adds to the suspensebr br I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD simply because it is genius It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy,1
Seriously I dont really get why people here are bashing it I meanbr br the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd The good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of Army of Darkness br br Especially in the second half of the film when the little killer snowballs attack I laughed my ass off For example the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la Gremlins 1 and mix it After that it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice That was funbr br Bottom line incredible movie rent it,1
Its been a while since Ive watched this movie and the series but now Im refreshing my memory This was a very funny movie based on the classic series Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes off their farm Bo and Luke sneak around Hoggs local construction site and find samples of coal They soon realize that Boss Hogg is gonna stripmine Hazzard County unless the Dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds wasnt right for the part of Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P Coltrane was way too serious Other than that I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD,1
I had never heard of this movie but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting so I figured Id give it a shot I found it to be very enjoyable Heath Ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough so he goes and asks for work from mobster Bryan Brown I wont go into details but things go very bad for Ledger and gets into big trouble with Bryan Brown From their on the movie just gets better and better with one scene involving Ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers And lets not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne who plays Ledgers love interest I would definitely recommend this movie,1
After 10 viewings in 20 years I too think this was the Crazy Gangs best effort on film with more cohesion in the plot than their next best Alfs Button Afloat They were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of royalty until Chesney Allen retired in the 40s through illhealth He outlived them all by years Apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one anotherbr br The Six Wonder Boys troupe head for IllGetHerToTellMe Alaska to dig for the gold that was being found there It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield because theyd been there When they get to Red Gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper theyd read tasted funny But by then it doesnt matter as theyve all fallen in love with Snow White and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold Baddie Bill M McGrew wants it himself howeverbr br The number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense to Brits and expats interested in seeing 30s British bw comedies Imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the Gold If patter between Bud Chesney and the Whistle While You Work pastiche even the Always Getting Our Man Mountie inserts A marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended,1
My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired reruns of it one summer in the 1970s We absolutely adored it There was something so exotic and mysterious about it especially when compared to the usual American reruns Petticoat Junction Green Acres you get the idea It had a similar feel to The Avengers not too much of a surprise since it was also British and in the spyadventure genrebr br I would love to see it again now hopefully it holds up Ive mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it so I began to wonder if Id imagined its whole existence But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans,1
The only part lacking in this movie is Shues part as the daughter wanting to follow in her aunts footsteps as a daytime soap star Otherwise it would be a perfect 10br br It seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script I have to wonder if a little ad libing wasnt taking place in parts It was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with youbr br Its a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once Id recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nosebr br Youll definitely want to watch the last scene closely Nurse Nan has a little secret shed rather not have shared with youbr br If you love daytime soaps or despise them this move pokes fun in all the right places,1
This is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver Inspector Clouseau in his stoicism and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There also Peter Sellers He is single yet doesnt have a clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at allbr br He has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood hes 28 and admits hes never had sexbr br Very good outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen where the two software people travel on business They try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail My theory is that theyre trying the wrong places they go to moreorless youth nightclubs they should try the type that has older people more their own agebr br Harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de Niro effort as in Taxi Driver urging his friendcolleague to go and stab some bloke whos pulled a nicelooking girl in the nightclubbr br Worth watching,1
Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching From that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is It is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known Its filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top DJs eg DJ QBert DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys showing off their stuff Going into the film I wasnt sure that scratching can really be called an art form or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right Scratch completely changed my mind on these points What these guys do with their turntables is truly amazingit is definitely some kind of artand the turntable if you know how to use it can be transformed into an instrument that you can play as much as a drum or a guitar And you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from DJ QBert eg how to use the fader to get different sound effects All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock perform his song Rock It you remember that song dont you live at the Grammys What got their attention was not Hancock himself but his DJ and his scratching Not only is Scratch about scratching but it does some scratching of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited There are moments where clips are quickly rewound and then forwarded several times which mirrors in the film medium what happens when a DJ quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader that wickawickawicka sound Whether youre a fan of hip hop or not you can count on Scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies After seeing it I had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own And I mean this as a compliment,1

Fearful Symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho Season ones Deep Throat takes place near Ellens Air Base also in southwest Idaho Im wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry Mulder and Scully have some good dialog always a plus Ed Meecham the zoo keeper reminds me of cranky old school teachers They must have liked children at one time you just cant imagine how Just like he must have cared more for animals at one point I liked the concept of the episode but I felt it had some inconsistencies If aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely why cant they put the animal back in the right place And the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals I dont buy Mulders theory of a problem with the spacetime continuum As if hes an expert on that I also thought Jayne Atkinsons performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done Besides those nitpicks I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal DNA as well as human DNA,1
I am a glutton for Bmovies I love the old DriveIn fare like this movie This film made for very little money it seems does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail It is cheezy It is gory It has no real plot but it entertained me for an hour and a half I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guys mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth and one grossout with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out But there is also loads of zombies and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a demon possessed scarecrow I loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people It has great camera work and some cool editing tricks This one is more original than the first Bloodbath and the undead look better but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70s and 80s and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high Dont expect Romero just secondrate Fulci I would say that Horror fans will like it and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through Bmovie Land,1
Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life When I saw it for the first time about 2 years ago I was in stitches for weeks after it To date I have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time For those who dont know Eddie Murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a Hollywood superstar There is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike Eddie Murphy Raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle If you are not the sort of person who cant stand swearing then I wouldnt advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 510 seconds I gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best,1
This is a really funny and sexy movie that is not just silly but has great acting Its the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater I saw it at the Boston film festival and I found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the movies more serious parts Its a unique movie about two doctors and I dont want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones plus the dialogue is great Wood Harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles If you get a chance to see it go you wont be disappointed Its worth seeing again Wood Harris deserves an award,1

I saw Anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as I watch a lot of foreign films in various genres you have to watch movies in their original language for sure Not only is it annoying to know the voices dont belong to the actors but they always seem cheerful like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something It makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and I have had to convert a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films arent as good as North American films that they arent Hollywood enough Also they translation is never right its too literal and screws up the vibe of the movie even if its basically saying the same thing I watched Anatomy by myself the other week in German then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didnt want to have to miss parts when he couldnt see the subtitles because he was typing 30 mins in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles He loved it Both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films Kelly,1
I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week Great acting by Al Pacino Jeremy Irons Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins Compare to other movies based on Shakespeares play this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow Bravo to Michael Radford for directing such top actors The costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in Venice it gives the film and authentic flavor I had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters antiSemitic behavior toward the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians I do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case I am sure that it will get few Oscar nominations,1

This is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am I glad he did The blend of British humor should I say Humour and the reality of a lost middleaged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the bushes were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film I laugh every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights Maybe its just my Mendocino County blood but the Brits definitely got this one right 1010,1
Besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is 1Stanley Kubrick 2God Allmighty 3the rest this movie actually is better than the book and the TV miniseries though this is an easy feat considering the director The flawless filming stile the acting and Kubricks all time number one skill the music make it THE masterpiece of horror I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got a hold of it IT BLEW ME AWAY It is far better than I ever imagined it It starts slow Kubrick trademark and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film Also the film doesnt offer a lot of gore it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless a trend that I hate in recent day horror films Just watch it,1
Before I start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseasbr br In australian slang thongs are a pair of rubber sandals not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear stubbies are a brand of australian short a stubby is a small can sized bottle of beer and a stubby holder is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beerbr br If you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie unfortunatley a lot of people on IMDB with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is A lot of reviewers have also compared it to LockStock and Pulp Fiction while it is the same genre it is a completely different and original stylebr br A lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using Heath Ledgers characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understandbr br This movie is also reminiscent of LockStock and Reservoir dogs in that it is the Directorwriters debut feature and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies as a matter of fact like LockStock and Reservoir Dogs I rate this movie as a 1010 for a directorwriters debut unfortunately unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like Ned Kellybr br This movie is one that you should definitely add to your DVD collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily,1
Too bad a couple of comments before me dont know the facts of this case It is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the Wilmington DEPhiladelphia PA region from 96 through 2000 I have to admit I was highly skeptical of how Hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and Philadelphia Inquirer news stories throughout the time period Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress who I really like in Cold Case who played Fahey looked nothing like her Anne Marie was actually prettier I have to admit though that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capanos and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period Details of the case were right onno deviations of dramatic effecteven down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler In conclusion I also wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many times at various functions a good man despite being a politician and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars,1

If Id only seen the poster for Nurse Betty I probably wouldnt have touched it with a tenfoot pole But after I heard some positive buzz and knowing it made some noise at Cannes I decided to give it a try What I got is a truly enjoyable movie based on a very entertaining plot Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse Betty a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience I also liked Morgan Freeman no surprise and was pleasantly surprised by foulmouthed comedian Chris Rock br br The film bounces continuously between comedy drama romance and thriller Yet despite this apparent identity crisis it holds up quite well I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story The entire cast is strong if not spectacular br br My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark In the Company of Men relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions The moodcreating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable And he did the standard old lets take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance trick just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face Why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiotsbr br But the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations In a very subpar year for movies Nurse Betty ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000 8 out of 10,1
This flick was even better then Waiting for Guffman The great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by Guest and Levys little secondsecond city troupe If one finds this movie boring or pointless God help em they just didnt get it It is a mockumentary something at which Guest and Levy have a genius for At the end of the movie where Guests southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to Israel to work on a caboose or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphicbr br of an ancient Egyptian holding a tiny ancient Egyptian in its hand I realized it is moments like this that make life worth living Thank you MrGuest and MrLevy and God bless you,1
I stopped short of giving Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House 1010 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit the fact that a black person is the faithful servant somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit But other than that the movies a hoot Portraying middle class New York couple Jim Cary Grant and Muriel Blandings Myrna Loy trying to build a house in Connecticut this flick has something for everyonebr br Grant is his usual flippant self while Loy does quite well as merely a wife But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jims and Muriels lawyer Bill Cole who seems to have more plans than hes making clear As for the house itselfthroughout most of the movie youll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there The builders contractors and others also provide their fair share of laughsbr br All in all a comedy classic Also starring Louise Beavers Reginald Denny Sharyn Moffett Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr,1
This production was made in the middle 1980s and appears to be the first serious attempt to put BLEAK HOUSE on celluloid No film version of the novel was ever attempted it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other so that it would have been very hard to prune it down The novel was the only attempt by Dickens to make a central narrator one of two in the work a woman Esther Summerson Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle who in typical Dickens style mistreat her She is illegitimate but they wont tell her anything about her parentage Later we get involved with the gentry Sir Leicester Dedlock and his wife Lady Honoria Deadlock Dame Diana Rigg is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor Tulkinghorn Peter Vaughn We also are involved with the actions of Richard Carstone Esthers boyfriend in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case Jarndyce v Jarndyce which everyone even Richards cousin John Jarndyce played by Desmond Elliot warns is not worth the effortbr br Dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS Dickens looked closely at the law Mr Bumble said it was a ass in OLIVER TWIST and Dickens would consistently support that view He looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in TWIST that the law barely tries to cure He attacks the Chancery and outdated estate laws as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers Tulkinghorn Vholes in BLEAK HOUSE In LITTLE DORRIT he attacks the debtors prisons he had hit it also in David COPPERFIELD In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial Dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries including Thackeraybr br But the novel also looks at other problems like charity and religious hypocrisy the budding Scotland Yard detective force social snobbery in the industrial revolution He also uses the novel to satirize various people Leigh Hunt the writer Inspector Fields of Scotland Yard and even the notorious Maria Manning Most of these points were kept in this fine miniseries version If it is shown again on a cable station catch it,1

The first time I saw this movie it didnt seem to go anywhere When I watched it a second time though it made a lot more sense Give it a chance watch it more than once there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it The Cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline The combination of Clooneys leading role blends well with Turturro and Nelsons supporting acts John Goodmans appearance in the movie is hilarious The soundtrack is great as well This movie has become a household favorite for my family 1010 for sure,1
First of all we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies youll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far and counting The story begins in the not so far future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story About that Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie youll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good But that doesnt mean that the ending wont pull your nerves cause its pretty good As far as the direction goes it is prefect Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better So if you are getting ready to see a SciFi movie or some action youll miss it B There should be more movies like this,1
Sharp wellmade documentary focusing on Mardi Gras beads I have always liked this approach to filmmaking communicate ideas about a larger more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to homebr br I am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and globalisms effect on poorer nations however people feel about it Rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox not that theres anything wrong with that other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras beads how they are manufactured by what people and under what conditions and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process It openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process including workers factory management American importers and finally the consumer at the end of the chainbr br I felt a little sickened by this equally by the Mardi Gras revelers but also by the way the workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed The footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end made a particular impression But that was just my reaction I can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differentlybr br Unlike other documentaries on this subject I dont think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume If you have ever bought a product made in the Far East this should give you something to think aboutbr br Outstanding and highly recommended Need to see more documentaries like this Kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film,1
I was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to IMDb users seeing if there was anything to review that I havent yet and I found this little screen gem One of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it Darn well I guess I will get ridiculed and spat upon here but for me this was a pretty good flick when I saw it It has been awhile however I remember it used to come on HBO late at night and I watched it two or three times and I havent seen it really since and I would love to watch it again now knowing Jolie was in it The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them I think that is basically all there is to it throw in a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie Some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well There is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other The dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film but for a bmovie it is really good I dont know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those,1
The story in this movie is fairly implausible B grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in 1940 that meant Peter Lorre And Peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner Stephen Danel who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine Upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danelbr br Only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves Danels wife and monkeys Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves getbr br Lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrialstrength fashion Although the script is not Casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes This is a very watchable story but Im not sure what niche this movie filled Too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film Im not sure how this was marketed to theatersbr br I just caught this for the first time on a late nightearly morning TCM showing Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they havent seen it,1
I saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical comingofage movie about a fairly atypical girl This is Parminder Nagra ERs breakout role playing Jess a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football thats soccer to us North Americans And even though shes actually much older than her character she plays the role pitchperfectbr br This is a movie about friendship specifically Jesss friendship with Jules Keira Knightley her teammate who is also going through family issues especially with her mom who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes and who wants Jules to be more feminine wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian Jules and Jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams They also unfortunately both love the same man Joe their coach played by Jonathan RhysMeyers The love triangle causes some strain in their friendshipbr br In some spots Bend It Like Beckham falls into clichés In others scenes drag on far too long and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editingbr br But this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up culture clash and the love of football Its about female empowerment chasing your dreams and supporting your friends Funny charming and fun Bend It Like Beckham is the little film that could and didbr br Excellent 810,1
Gary Busey is superb in this musical biography Great singing and excellent soundtrack The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba From reading other comments there may be some historical inaccuracies Regardless it is a fun toetapping film and a good introduction to Buddy Hollys music,1
Basically theres a family where a little boy Jake thinks theres a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the timebr br This movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombiebr br OK first of all when youre going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama As a drama the movie is watchable Parents are divorcing arguing like in real life And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spotsbr br 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs As for the shots with Jake just ignore them,0
This show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that By 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and its continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is todaybr br Its truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen The writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success As it is now the show is just awful I cant believe its still on the air,0
Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film Bad mistake Ive seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is Harvey Keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort One for Keitel obsessives only,0
Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlinesbr br At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didnt find the jokes or oddness funny anymorebr br Its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually I just lost interestbr br I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partakingbr br For something similar but better try Brother from another planet,0
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air The horror The horrorbr br As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end I didnt care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots I love them now for the unintentional humorbr br But about a year or so later I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star Janet Leigh was bumped off early in the film I sat up and took notice at that point Since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula There are no rules,0
So im not a big fan of Bolls work but then again not many are I enjoyed his movie Postal maybe im the only one Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished br br People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with These players go by the names of Til Schweiger Udo Kier and Ralf Moellerbr br Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz So the tale goes like this Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass People have complained about how hes not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we dont really know what he looked like when he was kicking a br br However the storyline in this film is beyond demented We see the evil mad scientist Dr Krieger played by Udo Kier making GeneticallyMutatedsoldiers or GMS as they are called Performing his topsecret research on an island that reminds me of SPOILER Vancouver for some reason Thats right no palm trees here Instead we got some nice rich lumberjackwoods We havent even gone FAR before I started to CRY mehehe I cannot go on any more If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience meaning most of it will suckbr br There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes Until the whole cromedalbino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse thats poop for you simpletons from a far if you wanna take a wiff go ahead BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes hes on screen,0
The cast played Shakespearebr br Shakespeare lostbr br I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so goodbr br Is it because The Scottish Play is my favorite Shakespeare I do not know What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler hence bowdlerization tried to do something similar in the Victorian erabr br In other words you cannot improve perfectionbr br I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it,0
Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film Ive ever seen Sort of like a high school film project What was Rosanna Arquette thinking And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town Pretty hard to get involved with this one No lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsenseWhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters And what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles Give this one a pass its like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa,0
This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies Horrible br br There wasnt a continuous minute where there wasnt a fight with one monster or another There was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another I had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them br br Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies LOTR Star Wars and Matrix br br Examplesbr br The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda Obee One and Vader br br The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings Elijah Wood is the victim in both films and waitit hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them upuh hellobr br And the whole machine vs humans theme WAS the Matrixor Terminatorbr br There are more examples but why waste the time And will someone tell me what was with the Nazis Nazis br br There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion The movie could not decide if it was a childrens movie or an adult movie and wasnt much of either br br Just awful A real disappointment to say the least Save your money,0
An awful film It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe Theyve taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition My complaint is not that theyve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine But its simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script I suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version Its hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if theyd favored the rest of the film with same brevity,0
I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in its entiretybr br All I have to say is save your time and money This has got to be the worst bmovie of all time it shouldnt even be called a bmovie more like an fmovie Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paperthin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake its almost funnyalmostbr br The movie is just packed full of crappy oneliners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bitbr br This movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are SO utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end They try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserablybr br Even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch,0
First of all lets get a few things straight here a I AM an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool b I DO like several BMovies because theyre hilarious c I like the Godzilla movies a lotbr br Moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like its going to be your usual Bmovie down to the crappy FX but all a sudden BOOM the anime comes on This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhillbr br The animation is VERY bad cheap even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER for crissakes In fact its so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie I vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school its the same kids over over again The FX are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla In addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue voicesespecially the English dub that I viewed was horrid I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD VHS player The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots JoelMike on MST3K you pick the season Honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same timebr br Heck Im planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a BMovie night Because its stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time Im giving this movie a 310 an improvement from the 0510 I was originally going to give itbr br According to my grading scale 310 means Pretty much both boring bad As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15,0
This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film Its great to see JBeals but shes only in the movie for a few minutes MParker is a much better actress than the part allowed for The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch There is no real emotional depth to the story A movie revolving about an actor who cant get work doesnt feel very original to me Nor does the development of the cop It feels like one of many straighttovideo movies I saw back in the 90s And not even a good one in those standardsbr br,0
This film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire Hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on It failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the endbr br Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR INC it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular filmbr br There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern,0
This movie was so frustrating Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time I at least thought Id be able to stand it But I was wrong First the weird looping It was like watching Americas Funniest Home Videos The damn parents I hated them so much The stereotypical Latino family I need to speak with the person responsible for this We need to have a talk That little girl who was always hanging on someone I just hated her and had to mention it Now the final scene transcends I must say Its so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own What crappy dancing Horrible and beautiful at once,0
My first exposure to the Templarios not a good one I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video which has brought us other cult classics such as Spider Baby The print quality is excellent but this alone cant hide the fact that the film is deadly dull Theres a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling Adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket,0
I watched this film not really expecting much I got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect and you know what I was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious I had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they dont half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot I thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and I havent even mentioned the killer Im not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining Anyway as far as Im concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London who was actually quite funny it wasnt because of their acting talent Ive certainly seen a lot worse but Ive also seen a lot better Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry,0
I bought this film at Blockbuster for 300 because it sounded interesting a bit Ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge I was 100 wrongbr br Having watched it I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity Honestly I dont usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what shes wearing a miniskirt of some sort Even the antireligious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightestit would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show This would barely qualify as PG13 it is Not Rated but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent thisas if it was pornographic Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream but they insist that Zack and Reba is worsebr br It is but not in that waybr br In a way this worries methe only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like The Virgin Suicides its teenagers If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect then I have little chance of turning a story Ive been writing into a PG13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers I think its number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by itbr br Just say no to this movie though 210,0
The plot is about the death of little children Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter In the end the serial killer get caught Thats it But before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors It is unbelievable how bad these actors are including Hopper I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time Just dont watch the movie Ive warned you,0
Ever watched a movie that lost the plot Well this didnt even really have one to begin withbr br Where to begin The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the housegreat double glazing The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house Or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of directionbr br Add a lead actress who cant act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hopebr br Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder dont worryits telegraphed at least ten minutes beforebr br After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe What do they do Slide down and run like the rest of us No of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weaponbr br It really IS only a movie as they say,0
After sitting through this pile of dung my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie It was that listless and formulaic But the US propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat its the work of humans Call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq etc The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene The reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow And theres also a bonus side plot of misogyny with Dr WhateverHerNameWas being chided by all involved for never shutting up Shes clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a Dr title on her character to give her some gravity At one point Cages character says Dont you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like shes a child Truly grotesque The only benefit to this movie was that its so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it Creepy,0
It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it The production was good however the script and acting were Bmovie quality The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors The good actors didnt hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br This movie is not worthy of more words but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br If you are looking for mindless entertainment I still wouldnt recommend this movie,0
Of all the films I have seen this one The Rage has got to be one of the worst yet The direction LOGIC continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy Gary Busey is know for his B movies but this is a sure W movie Wwastebr br Take for example about two dozen FBI local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer Inside the jeep is MA and is confused as to why all the cops are about Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues MA being killed straight off The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough Truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle,0
I had heard good things about States of Grace and came in with an open mind I thought that Gods Army was okay and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker The film began with some shaky acting and I thought well maybe it will get better Unfortunately it never did The picture starts out by introducing two elders Mormon missionaries and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them Instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughablebr br Dutchers only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience The film in no way reflects reality Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgaritybr br The conclusion which Im assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy Next time Dutcher try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with,0
Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldies charm just doesnt save this movie Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan dont go out of your way to see this film,0
How this film could be classified as Drama I have no idea If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen I would be trying to erase this from my CV It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah Lot Abrahams nephew Lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born Canaanites wandered the earthreally What were the scriptwriters thinking Was it just ignorance I remember something about Noah and animals and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from Christians Jews and Muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one,0

The 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support W Bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 911 sociopolitical landscape Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the awhupping they deserve Its really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him cant be denied the right to ever vote again Theyve clearly shown they have no sense of characterbr br What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology cant help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism Execution and murder Selfdefense and patriotism His legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation hes helped create Sound like any belligerent overprivileged retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of br br Wojciech Pszoniak blows the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen As sympathetic as Robespierres plight is its comforting to know that shortly after the film ends hell have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine,0
As someone has already mentioned on this board its very difficult to make a fake documentary It requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial distance a plausible premise a narrative flow and REALLY believable acting aka GREAT acting br br Such is not the case with Love Machine It starts to show its faux hand about the 20minute mark with 60 minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in Its downhill from therebr br Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon But to be fair to Eriksen his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a REAL doc couldnt get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his filmbr br The premise people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website was perhaps more interesting in 199798 when the film was made Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff a pushy host handheld cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites all I guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesnt work The film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue,0
The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more Of course its not going to be an Oscar nominated film its just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutesbr br The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert Its just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audiencebr br Id give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment something to pass time if youre bored and nothing elsebr br 410,0
I laughed all the way through this rotten movie Its so unbelievable A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office What happens The office manager comes outside and offers her a job Hilarious Next thing you know the two women are going at it Yep theyre lesbians Nothing rings true in this Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do movie Clunky dialogue like I dont want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didnt take it doesnt help Theres a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughters new relationship A sassy black maid unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which theres a sassy black maid Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids Sheesh No cliche is left unturned,0
What happened What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it Actually it never really got going There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it Steve Martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters Kate and Angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot,0
Ive just watched Fingersmith and Im stunned to see the 810 average rating for the showbr br Not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly appliedbr br The actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional Once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tediousbr br And just in case anyone didnt see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the filmbr br The end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went Ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the eveningbr br Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it,0
Besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark The movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message What were the redeeming qualities On top of that I dont think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did,0
An unmarried woman named Stella Bette Midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man Stephen Collins He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own Things go OK until the child named Jenny Trini Alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worsebr br Ive seen both the silent version and sound version of Stella Dallas Neither one affected me much and I cry easily but they were wellmade if dated Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of Beaches to get this made This predictably bombed The story is laughable and dated by todays standards Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason both good actors dont help in supporting roles Flimsy and dull Reallywho thought this would work See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead I give this a 1,0

I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie It didnt have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD The music was not bad it was quite nice Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an Indian film The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes Ali Larter Her acting had a lot to be desired However she did look good in the Indian dresses that she wore All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better on his next movie Thank you,0
Im not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not Even though Marques Houston did appear in HP3 he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film Okayso Reid and Martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry a film all by themselvesbut to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies Im sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinkedinto thinking that they were seeing a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name And Im sorryKym Whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the earlier films Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversionI have to give this a THUMBS DOWN Just naming the film Down to the Last Minute would have been OK Furthermore the Hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film,0
This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen The writer obviously bought the playbook How to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play In particular the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time againbr br Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project But judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand To learn that the film was nominated for a Special Visual Effects Emmy has me absolutely gobsmackedbr br I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effectsbr br And the plot holes are too numerous to mention But I will pick one out as an example Now Im no NASA expert but surely its highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pearshaped with the program Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twentynine year old who has not been in the control room beforebr br The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this scriptbr br I give this film 2 out of 10 with the aboveaverage work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark,0
Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield Ty Webb is funny being the only character from the original Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original Henry Wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt being played by Randy Quaid Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office I dont go in for law suits or motions I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a fing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it And then Im comin upstairs junior and Im grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a Do we have an understanding Offsetting his small role however is Dan Acroyd who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it,0
Honestly this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I havent made up my mind if this helps or hinders it If the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others are more shocking than in AFTERMATH All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull This is an expensive beautifully filmed turd Its not that shocking its not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it rent it I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore but other than that absolutely nothing going for this overhyped mess On the other hand GENESIS Cerdas sequel to AFTERMATH now available as a double feature released by Unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material Although I dont care for AFTERMATH at all GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future,0
Upon viewing Tobe Hoopers gem Crocodile in 2000 I developed a great interest in the collegecrocodile niche of the exploitationmonster genre I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all wed need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implantsbr br While Tobe Hoopers crocky opus referenced his own movies Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusionshomagesripoffs to Jaws Temple of Doom Indiana Jones Last Crusade The Convent Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie Also try to find the readyfortv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stockbr br I was disappointed the crock didnt get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalismor crocky appreciation but the quasiCaptain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach Perhaps in the coming years well see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset Or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zeroG monkeymidgetcrocodile bloodshedbr br Allinall the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me,0
Maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the DVD which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like a buffoon but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator Turns out its way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever Theres a problem and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies And with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creaturekillerwhatever Entrails of a Virgin has neither Its safe to say its a pretty soulless movie even if isnt one of the very worst ever made its there just for horndog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other headsbr br In this case were given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by A Murderer as hes credited First off the director Kazuo Gaira Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere It looks like its from another movie Then once settled into the house theres a wrestling scene thats poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings First the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time Then the Murderer who like DAmatos creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men andor rapes the women one by onebr br Now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie This is like saying however that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad An eyegouging scene a spike thrown like an Olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name I cant remember Even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title On top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through Gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors youd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one where its just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him You just want it to be done with for the I hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether,0
The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes When Sharif or please God Palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass What does that leave us with One comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castros manic and unremitting cigarfellatio Never trust a Medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a HISTORICALLY awful movie,0

Fate leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 As the story unfolds in real life and fiction Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually endbr br The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential The screenplay was probably the worst part about it It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time The second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awfulbr br Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that hes still capable of making a stinker He has the movie drenched in style but he just cant get a good focus He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace He switches from reality to whats actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying The actual book in the film thats titled The Number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears When Carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery At this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension We impatiently wait for the movie to reach its horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finishedbr br The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didnt even seem to be trying He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston Overall The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills Rating 310,0
We brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play The film is barely watchable and the acting is dire The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughablebr br Just terrible,0
This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous And i have never seen such bad acting in my life The only good part about the movie were all the hot guysespecially Drew Fuller I dont know what these people were thinking when they made this movie I didnt even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch I was very disappointed The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion,0
This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds I wouldnt call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end If you dont want to know much about the plot dont keep readingbr br Gilberts character Ophelia is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent Brad Johnson also an excellent actor is Matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce He is gentle convincing and compelling in this rolebr br The two meet on the beach through her daughter Pip and initially Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in lovebr br The chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical Two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together I wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshellbr br I wanted mindless entertainment and I got it with this In regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable A Secret Affair with Janine Turner is far superior not a Steele book as are some of Steeles earlier books turned into film,0

Nicholas Walker is Paul the local town Reverand whos married to Martha Ally Sheedy but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair Veronica Dara Tomanovich However in so doing he gets a bout of amnesia hence the name of the film Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of Misery type of way Its sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator In a film billed as a black comedy one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie While this does bring the former in spades it sadly contains none of the latter Furthermore you cant emphasize with any of the characters and as thus have absolutely no vested interest in them Technically not an alltogether bad movie just an extremely forgettable onebr br Eye Candy Dara Tomanovich gets topless Sally Kirkland also shows some skin br br My Grade C br br Where I saw it Showtime Showcase,0
Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap reinvented over and over again Take superheroes for example for each XMan and Spiderman there are Daredevil Elektra Ghost Rider and Hulk Japanese horror remakes are even worst It only took The Ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of Mr Gore Verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors eg The Ring 2 The Eye Dark Water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesbr br The first Grudge wasnt entirely bad It was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it Plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy Men in Black II Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain For the Grudge 2 the critic goes the same waybr br Tired scares bad acting except for Amber Tamblyn and clichés all over the place Three stories take place on different places and time There is Aubrey Tamblyn investigating what drove her sister Karen Sarah Michelle Gellar to death Allison Arielle Kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door Glad to say and I mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullbr br The chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep Meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic Hey doesnt that seem just like another bad Japanese remake something called Pulse Yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against Hollywood bullshits,0

I watched this series out of curiositywanting to see if they could possibly and with ALL this modern technologyout do Cecil B DeMilles classic epic of 1956 starring Charleton HestonYul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke Of course I was let down Yes they had all the Biblical characters correct but they didnt give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest throughout the first movie If you going to have a miniseries you have to have some rivoting scenes the Burning bush Parting the RED Seadrowning Pharohs Armies building Sethis Pyramids could have been done with todays technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as Lord of the Rings or the Matrix Obviously they didnt want to leave a LASTING impression of faith and sacrifice which is much needed in these trouble times,0
My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline I was never completely lost but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slotbr br If it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good The movies most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making Heras followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus followers do or believe The movie is also interesting because you dont see the gods and theres no real certainty that they exist So its got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesnt do anything useful with thembr br Bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons Not unwatchable but also not worth watching,0
Well I like to watch bad horror BMovies cause I think its interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie I always compare this movies to for example some Spielbergs works and againandagain dont understand the huge difference in what I see I like Ed Woods movies cause its so inept its very funny But people The Chilling is not funny and is not even interesting Its EXTREMELY BORING horror movie without ANYTHING what makes even bad movies watchable Theres no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood Its extremely inept amateurish film Its definitely the WORST movie I had ever seen and I had seen a lot of worst movies believe me I warned you 110,0

Okay last night August 18th 2004 I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival Heres what I have to say about it First of all the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger Roman Polanski Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie Ive ever seen Second of all in a short Q A session after the show Mr Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his Van Bebbles take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news and Im assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative So I had second dibs on questions I asked if he was trying to present the outsider Mtv sex drugs and rock n roll version and not necessarily the true story This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting f you shut the f up this is the truth All those other movies are bullshbr br Well anyway I didnt even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film Youve heard the laws side of the storynow hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family Excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesnt want to have anything to do with how in Gods name can he tell the story for them This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock n roll mind of a man who couldnt even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen This film accomplishes little more than warping the publics image of actual events which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today into some sort of SlasherComic BookPornoRape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individualbr br The film was definitely very impressive to look at The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlies work with the Family off of his Lie album The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presentedbr br All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie or maybe it was Linda declares at the end You can write a bunch of bullsh books or make a bunch of bullsh moviesetc etc Case in point Even the disclaimer Based on a True Story is a dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book insteadbr br All I can say is this when the film ended I got a free beer so Im glad I went but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f up for asking the director a question Peace,0
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of deathbr br This movie like the others of that era contrives to bring this about and the viewer knows this There is no mystery or suspense The people squabble but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time it is laughablebr br The five people happen upon two savage young characters and go nuts Everyone is nuts so that the directorwriter team can justify their Nazi propagandabr br For some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde who is really not much to look at and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over One must remember that in the seventies movies were meant to appeal to women and not menbr br Totally crap and totally depressing,0
While Star Trek the Motion Picture was mostly boring Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad In this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth Romulus and Kronos the Klingon home world have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier There he hopes to find God Using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a godlike alien This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin At the core is a good idea that is never really developed The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco The action scenes dont have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner When he takes the directors chair the ego gets bigger Most of the focus is on him Spock and McCoy but does not give the others enough to do Moreover whereas Shatner is usually guilty of overacting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one Now Kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song Row Row Row your Boat in a round by a campfire In any case this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise I should have given it three out of ten instead of five,0
Apparently the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this socalled movie They described blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence I saw no intrigue I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie I saw no violence At least I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with impervious skinbut here I am perhaps revealing too much of the plot Furthermore as a viewer of many and sundry films some of which include the occasional kung fu movie I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable Whatever you may choose to do I will always remainbr br Correctbr br Jonathan Tanner br br br br PS I was not blinded by the choreography,0
I liked Boyles performance but thats about the only positive thing I can say Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity Most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9yearold nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stonehearted cop or an ultraevil villain The raspy voiceovers seemed amateurish to me I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music And whats with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story Cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story Thats a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges stories so good is his minimalism they are tightly bound with no superfluous details This movie is just the opposite I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung or thereabouts I wasted 4 renting this but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake,0
Its terrific when a funny movie doesnt make smile you What a pity This film is very boring and so long Its simply painfull The story is staggering without goal and no funbr br You feel better when its finished,0
Usually Im a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beensbut this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically Corey Haims performance was abysmal as usual Nicole Eggert was not much better This has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actoractress in this piece of trash stay away,0
I have now seen quite a few films by Pedro Almodóvar but this would have to be the most disappointing so far This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested Many Almodóvar regulars appear in this film so its not like there was a lack of onscreen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films If there was a comedic edge to this movie I certainly couldnt find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie,0
I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwoods novel The Robber Bride and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an excop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead womans crazy female friends Its fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms Atwoods clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming womenbr br Heh Okay you got me If these guys are mentioned in the book and Im pretty sure theyre entirely made up for the movie Ill eat the dust cover of my hardback copy Apparently the three main female characters of the novel arent enough to carry the movie Zenias manipulations arent interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a mans life is screwed up Roz Charis and Toni tell their stories to a man Because its not important if a man doesnt hear thembr br I liked the characters in the book It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a mans story I normally do not look for feminist angles on media and I tried to enjoy the movie as is If I hadnt read the book I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more So if you like the cop and the excop and you want to read more about them youre out of luck Read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot Its the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst Its like Zenias revenge on Margaret Atwood,0

Ah yes the 1980s a time of Reaganomics and Sly Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies At the time I couldnt believe how movies like RAMBO MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN made money at the box office theyre turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly TROMAS WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but youve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place Of course not TROMAS WAR lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that theres no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up Maybe it is,0
I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by Apix entertainment and without exception everything this company deals with is pure crap First and this is very important never ever watch this movie sober Why would you Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies this one I feel was made intentionally bad I just cant get over how fake the snowman is which is why its always shown only briefly the way it moves is the best This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap becuz that was made too be a good movie and that version is as bad as this,0
Revolt of the Zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesnt necessarily make lightning strike twicebr br The Halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic White Zombie made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled closeups of Lugosis eyes from that previous film There was a court battle with the White Zombie films rights owners who didnt want the Halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title That word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word Zombie appear in the title Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle The zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victimsbr br Wanna create a mindcontrolled army of zombies Be ready to crack a few eggs including your ownbr br THE LAME PLOT Man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous This sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mindcontrol techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isnt worth spitbr br This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments Ive ever seen Youd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming The acting isnt even good This movie makes the racially insensitive King of the Zombies which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic It makes the atomic age scifi alien zombie cheese fest Invisible Invaders seem like a serious drama This is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a Korean film fan twitch South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama The credits list the ironically named company Favorite Films Im not sure whose favorite film this would be but theyre obviously an idiotbr br Not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films,0
The complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women I am okay with these night time soaps like Greys Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end However when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men Taye Diggs Tim Daly and Chris Lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a socalled little hospital it seems like General Hospitalor a female counterpart to Baywatch That was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic,0
The Danish Bladerunner is boldly stated on the box Are you kidding me This film is a complete drag When Im thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen I usually pause the vcr so I wont miss anything Not this time I actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge just so I wouldnt have to go back Why the hell is there not ONE sciencefictionscriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work Its mindboggling One of the premises of film is that our hero whos a hacker has a little computerassistant to help him the Microsoft Office paperclip finally caught on in the future When he loses the assistant in the movie hes helpless and cant get into any computers HES A HACKER Its like saying that you cant drive your car if you dont have your lucky drivingcap on I wont even go into the lightningeffect when he recieves electroshock,0
This movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off I know these horrible things happen in the world but Im watching movies based on the fact that what Im watching is not actually happening on the screen These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other speciesbr br This should be banned and destroyed I have also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the marketbr br This movie should be removed from the public The person who made this movie needs psychological help,0
Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee Carol Alt and Corey Feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something Id love to try sometime Where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy acting action in places This is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washedup hasbeen and neverwass love to star in I actually felt embarrassed for the stars in this film The only thespian missing to top this turd was Gary Coleman who if he would have been in the movie would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad rather than just plain badbr br There was one part in the film where Carol Alt screamed DO YOU THINK IM AN IDIOT Yes Carol I do your agent does and PLEASE for the love of all that is decent and holy GO AWAY and stop degrading yourself like this This film is something Anna Nicole Smith would take part inbr br I would tell you what the plot was but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway so I barely paid attention,0
This film could have been a decent remake and gosh knows it tried or Ms English tried Assembling talented actors together with a successful experienced writerdirector should be a formula for a decent film But Ms Englishs experience according to her IMDb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this filmbr br I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television To give some credit to Ms English many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV and maybe a laugh track would have helped So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen If the whole film had been chopped up into a miniseries or a sitcom I think it could have worked But this is cinema and sadly Ms Englishs talents didnt translate I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled Meg Ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent She has made films where she doesnt recreate her stereotyped role and done them well but not here Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see What worked in this film in the 1930s doesnt translate to the 2000s and no one helped Ms English get the changes updates or subtleties right If only she as writer director AND producer had reached out for some assistance I think it could have been good But it was notbr br Its so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyones time money This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate A few movie execs are having a meeting the caption reads Lets remake a classic with worse everything,0
Cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode Its just an old 60s TV show This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe Yeoman Barrows ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesbr br This use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showbr br Except a few notable exceptions ie The city on the edge of forever assignment Earth and Tomorrow is Yesterday The old series of Star Trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting averagebr br This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a LOT of rubbish He doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for examplebr br Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view They used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels You can clearly see the folds in the paper Every expense spared or what,0
I caught this film on AZN on cable It sounded like it would be a good film a Japanese Green Card I cant say Ive ever disliked an Asian film quite the contrary Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean and I am a HUGE fan of John Woos Hong Kong films I an not adverse to a light hearted films like Tampopo or Chung King Express two of my favourites so I thought I would like this Well I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever againbr br I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude because no one in this film had a personality And when any of the characters DID try to act as opposed to mumbling a line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted beforethe ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy because I didnt laugh once Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this a refreshing breath of comedy It was neither refreshing nor a breath of comedy And the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such thingsbr br AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting I actually think that Spike of Bensonhurst is a better acted film than thisand I walked out half way through that film,0
Before I begin let me get something off my chest Im a huge fan of John Eyres first film PROJECT SHADOWCHASER The film a Bgrade cross of both THE TERMINATOR DIE HARD may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit spawned two sequels a spin offbr br Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the socalled Bloody Shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her Michael Silvano a washedup football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his sons coach But once executed Meeker returns as a revenant or as Kelly Perine calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making Silvanos life a miserybr br Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film It is a supernatural action film with Meeker chasing Silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator a French chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown a standup comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesnt stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle to pay Silvano back for killing Meekers wifebr br Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of But that is the films main flaw since theres nothing to connect the action scenes together The acting is surprisingly good with Keith delivering the best performance supported ably by Kove as well as Paul Koslo who plays the washedup cop quite well Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse,0
Ye Lous film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization Purple Butterfly against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai Ding Hui Zhang Ziyi and her exlover Hidehiko Itami Toru Nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meetingbr br I agree with the reviewer from Paris The film substitutes a convoluted semihistorical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes The sudden time shifting doesnt help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless Normally I dont mind dark movies but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but I dont think that helps the movie The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century and I dont believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film The overly melodramatic moments dont add to its watchabilitybr br The actors are all suitably melancholy Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed However at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminatorbr br All in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He 210,0
After hearing about George Orwells prophetic masterpiece for all of my life Im now 37 but never having read the book I am totally confused as to what Ive just seenbr br I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as im sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it Im still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched itbr br On the plus sidebr br The cinematography is amazing Hurt Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film makingbr br Now for the down sides and there are plentybr br There is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who Nothing is explained There are a couple of names bandied about Eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanationbr br Who is Winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isnt he on the front line Why doesnt he eat the food in the canteen What is that drink hes drinking through the entire film Why is he so weak ill Why isnt he brainwashed like the rest of them Whats the deal with his mother sister What happened to his father A little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that havent read the book Without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow arthouse movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going onbr br The soundtrack was disjointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but its very annoying all the samebr br Also I know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coveragebr br I personally cant abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days We are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is a few steps too far the other way I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that Ive seen many people say I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it isbr br Theres no denying that it was light years ahead of its time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many scifi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storylinebr br I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if im to make any sense out of thisbr br All in all very disappointed in something Ive waited for years to watch,0

This movie was not very well directed they almost totally disregarded the bookI guess they were trying 2 save time the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute Some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book Major parts of the book were once again chopped outYou lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely Also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary Also i was surprised not pleasantly by a new character that was no where in the bookOne of my favorite characters leper was poorly interpreted and portrayed He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book Over all disappointing,0

Robert Altmans downbeat newfangled western from Edmund Naughtons book McCabe was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following Aside from a completely convincing boomtown scenario the characters here dont merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally brackish and unappealing Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel once the profits start coming in Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action Altman creates a solemn wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand Altmans pacing is deliberately slow Theres hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds Its a selfdefeating picture and yet in an Altmanquirky way it wears defeat proudly from,0
I dont think Ive ever gave something a 110 rating but this one easily gets the denomination I find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes Its not just that the jokes are so bad but combine that with the fact that Carson Daily has zero charisma cant set up or finish a punchline and youve got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomachbr br I have watched the show never in its entirety but many times still It just creeps up on me after Conan I usually watch a minute or two just to see if Carson daily is still the worst talk show host everbr br Actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest its just that an interview I feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language thats screaming get me the hell away from this freak I do recommend watching the show not for a laugh but to ponder how he got on the air and what hes still doing there Watch as much as you can I think you will find its complete awkwardnessinteresting,0
In the standard view this is a purely awful movie However it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale I can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as I did watching this movie Andy Griffiths ghost dressed in Native American garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime I wouldnt waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on TV check it out,0
From the films first shot Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strongminded rebellious female character in period drama I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myselfbr br Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austens subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawingrooms but a sort of Ucertificate Wuthering Heights Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain Not to mention that Jane Austen and in particular P P is not about passion sexual tension or love Its about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society Which was completely ignored so that the Bennets house was a rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style danceorgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for proprietybr br The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performancesbr br It was so obviously trying to be a serious film The humour which IS Pride Prejudice both Austens methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this pofaced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily Pride Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it You cant lose Jane Austens technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavyhanded mysticalnuminous fauxbrow cinematographybr br Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clearsighted Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an emptyheaded giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an emptyheaded schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine Elizabeths wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybodys follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clearsightedness were completely lost and replaced with what A lot of giggling and staring into the distance Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits And where the great strength of Austens Elizabeth at least in Austens eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety Knightleys Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention Furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strongminded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance In which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by Matthew Macfaydenbr br Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic His special bond with Lizzie as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and wellmeaning to the point of folly but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedybr br Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache,0
The story is very trustworthy and powerful The technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it The main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression Beside the small role of the father Rafael played impressively by Asi Dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best The role of the elder Blind girl played by Taly Sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie But after all its a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future,0
You know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or whatever it is and hes trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink Thats a great metaphor for this movie I kept watching even though it was really difficult But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth I should have spit it out when I had the chancebr br The premise is corny enough to be fun For the first time in like a thousand years Gargoyles have returned to Romania and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead Its up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok Unfortunately the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads The best acting is done by the CG Gargoylesbr br In the end this movie feels like a poor mans Van Helsing If you check your brain at the door this might get you through a dreary Monday night I gave it 3 out of 10 stars,0
I cant believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i laughed a couple of times probably because of how stupid it was If someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldnt the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that i couldnt even tell if they were trying that movie was terrible rating F,0

This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner Along with other such nasty films as The Burning Bed Enough or Monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why shes not such a bad person after all Give us a break Heres my question to the filmmakers If LeTourneau were a man and Vili were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person Answer Hell nobr br Imagine switching the genders in this film and then youll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage Were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal Instead wed likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sexbr br Lets call a spade a spade LeTourneau is a pedophile Plain and simple No ifs ands or buts Shes a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy,0
The premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dullbr br SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasnt like the guy set out to do it Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree There is no emotion in this film The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message It was dull and boringbr br With some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good,0
The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy quaint streets and sunshine I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowherebr br Othello works for big fat Mr Karva his crimeboss stepdad at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because its never really defined but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers so trust me hes a prick doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy handjobs One of his colleagues is Runner a black dude who is always dashing from A to B Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running Runner dumps the lost boy in Othellos flat where he promptly starts granting more wishes Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled Karva has the boy kidnapped But he isnt sure of what would really bring him happiness Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another handjob Either way I dont want to see the little boy grant him the secondbr br It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes The ending tries to be shocking but since theres hardly any backstory on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audiencebr br Writer Tony Grisoni a favourite of Terry Gilliam tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell ironically If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film As it is we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy Whos origins are never revealed Thats just plain irritating br br Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score this film has little to recommend,0

Why cant a movie be rated a zero Or even a negative number Some movies such as Plan Nine From Outer Space are so bad theyre fun to watch THIS IS NOT ONE The Dungeon of Horror might be the worst movie Ive ever seen some of anyway I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age there may be worse movies Ive seen but thankfully I cant remember them The sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint The special effects looked like a fifth graders C diorama set in a shoebox The movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant He then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it without the gun having been reloaded This movie was so bad my DVD copy only had name credits I guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated Though I guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isnt needed This movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as The Manipulator the worst movie I have ever seen with an actual one time Hollywood leading manMickey Rooney The only time I would recommend watching The Dungeon of Harrow or The Manipulator for that matter would be if someone were to pay you Im kind of cheap Id have to have 7 or 8 bucks for Dungeon and at least ten for Manipulator philthe never out of the can cinematographer,0
Though Id heard that Cama de Gato was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade I watched it giving it a chance after all firsttime directorproducerwriter Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just US 4000 and though it looks even cheaper I cant begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as I watched it I realized why But whatever chances youre ready to give to Cama de Gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes its an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian uppermiddle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neoNazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and theyre made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure Visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube only here it lasts NINETY TWO countem minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and its not even funnybadbr br Weve all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong theres gangrape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill Moral and literal garbage get it The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark especially Kids and Bully but Clarks films though also moralist and sexploitative are highclass masterworks compared to this crapbr br I dont think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his nonstop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion you DO get numbminded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on Stockler doesnt care a bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but hes a narcissistic controlfreak he anticipates the criticisms hes bound to get by adding subtitles with smartiecutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all is I could relate to THAT br br Despite his megalomaniac ambitions Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure he cant even decide if he wants gritty realism handheld video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc Damn he cant even decide WHERE to put his camera theres use of subjective camera for the THREE leads The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for All you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with itbr br Its very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil with his sleepyeyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineos Blat can be highly effective under good direction as in Carandiru Lavoura Arcaica Proibido Proibir Here hes told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly underequipped actors in recent memory He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like webcam pornbr br The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical middleclass youth Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what hes trying to preach in fiction But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middleclass youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE theyre middleclass and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neofascists are on drugs Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior I couldnt tell br br With its dogmatic selfrighteousness headacheinducing technique and mindbending boredom Cama de Gato is bad for a 1000 reasons but above all its harmful in a very insidious manner it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument Cama de Gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten,0
This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message but the message was a cliché hopeless mess to begin with This movie falls on shameless environmental point even making a selfrighteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planetbr br In sitting through this I couldnt help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes Her character gets frequent cringeworthy lines where they absolutely do not fitbr br Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty Evan Almighty blows its whole recordbreaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evans ark but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God Yes God was trying to influence politics,0

The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumis fate as an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first sagabr br Thats as poetical as Ill get when talking about Azumi 2 Death or Love because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blooddriven assassin after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever beforebr br Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape But I wont hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumis way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma By the way Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go minus the cool weapon and sense of menacebr br This brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the Death side of the epic In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons To no ones surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily In Azumi 1 the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enrichedbr br The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolutionbr br As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation I wont lie and Ill admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film but Ill step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2 the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece For what its worth Azumi 2 Death or Love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying,0

While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of The Gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing Worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series,0
I dont believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club They are todays equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans as well as billions of humans the world over who dont happen to share their bigoted cruel monstrous and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth such as the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill so lost are they in their fantasy Sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldnt let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy However The 700 Club is in a class by itself They are truly a cult While I believe in freedom of speech they way they spread hatred lies disinformation and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion The 700 Club though is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of cult but due to The 700 Clubs vast wealth conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip they are above the law in this country For those of you who have seen the movie The Matrix you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around thembr br In less civil times the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks But in todays world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague br br The television ratings system and the V chip on TVs should also have a rating called R for religion so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country from themselves and their children,0

I have seen most if not all of the Laurel Hardy classic films I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly even after watching it over and over again This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel Hardy however fails miserably for various reasons One of which is how out of place their cloths are still early 20th century however are both portrayed in the 90s setting Some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever The real Laurel Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation,0
I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway I mention this for two reasons one to prove Im not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the nightbr br We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you cant avoid them all theyll eventually get you Pretty Woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute were talking about here has a great life shes healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament My feeling is this happy Hooker type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it If I make a film about a chef but dont want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really lame br br Secondly Pretty Woman insults romance itself Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that is without his plastic friend yep dont leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her its the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money wheres the charm wheres the charisma dont mention that attempt at the piano pleasebr br Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator as they probably dont either so it wont have registered More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate Thieves Highway a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subjectbr br Ill finish on a songbr br Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman the kind I like to treat Pretty woman I dont believe you Youre not the truth No one could spend as much as you Mercybr br Pretty woman wont you pardon me Pretty woman I couldnt help but see Pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like mebr br Pretty woman shop a while Pretty woman talk a while Pretty woman sell your smile to me Pretty woman yeah yeah yeah Pretty woman look my way Pretty woman say youll stay with meand Ill pay youIll treat you right,0
This movie was terrible The plot was terrible and unbelievable I cannot recommend this movie Where did this movie come from This movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including Gary Sinise Kathy Bates Joey Lauren Adams and Jennifer Tilly,0
I strongly dislike this show I mean like basically everyone at that school is perfect and rich and I doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that And why do they suddenly allow girls into the school Isnt that just a little weird anyways Jamie Lynn spears CANNOT act She always has the same facial expression which really annoys me She is basically emotionless and all the guys seem to like herbr br and shouldnt chase tell her he likes her its not that hard really None of this show is real life and she isnt a girl like me because majority of the regular girls do NOT go to boarding school do not have designer clothes and do NOT live by the beachbr br fake fake fake,0

I cant believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long long timebr br In a nobudget way it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreckbr br This film should be avoided at all costs Its one of those festival films that only please the pseudointellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore goodbr br Bad filmmaking is not different its just bad filmmaking,0
Ed Wood rides again The fact that this movie was made should give any youngbr br aspiring film maker hope Any screenplay you might have thought of using tobr br line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids Watching thisbr br movie made me realize that Boa vs Python was not that bad after all It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film It is understandable why this director has so many aliases There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you tobr br make your toward your TV sets cocoon of cheese that surrounds it,0
This sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk The first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other br br The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that its really a chick flick and little else This probably plays on the Lifetime networkbr br There was a quick murder scene and then more talk By halfway through they had lost me br br By the way Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here,0
When the opening shot is US Marines seriously disrespecting the US flag a movie has a tough road ahead but unfortunately it was downhill from there There is a military adviser credited who is also apparently a retired US Marine making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol and law went unnoticed Even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a Marine is reported KIA then buried in very short order without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body or if there even was a body The US government is still finding the missing from WWII and it takes months to identify the remains Military shot down remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains have been positively identified or after years of red tape Here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks Maybe this happens in Denmark but not in the US Clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with or respect for the US militarybr br Beyond that there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere There must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash Having a script that worked might have helped but this one seems to have been made up on the spot working from Cliffs Notes Theres no way to know if the script was this awful originally or if it was the auteur or the middlemanagement kids at the studio who bear responsibility Either way this is an awful movie that should have never been made,0
I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a whilewhat with all its raving reviews nominations and media attention And I must say the first quarter of the movie was good It really portrayed the black music scene back then However as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits The singing just kept coming one after the other I mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENTbr br Furthermore I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters I just didnt care what happened to them Even when Eddie Murphys character died of a drug overdose I knew I should have been sad but I just couldnt feel any emotion for that character The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me inbr br Finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development This movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on Ray Chicago and Rent Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances,0
This movie is really bad Most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement Theres a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg There are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth And the plot is a bunch of postapocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all The whole thing is just laughable,0
This movie is not worth anything I mean if you want to watch this kind of stuff flip to Hollywood movies This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name Neal N Nikki seriously sucked Never watch this movie As for the actors it appears the acting genes skipped a generation Tanisha couldnt have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the directors spoiled son All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid The songs are eh and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it Bottom line I hated the movie Do not let your kids watch it and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it Buy the CD if you must As I said the songs are eh At least it is better then the movie,0
Apparently The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of selfmutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood I use the word apparently because without listening to a director Andy Copps commentary which I didnt have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers wont have a clue what it is aboutbr br Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling reallife footage but unless theyre also fond of pretentious headacheinducing experimental arthouse cinema theyll find this one a real chore to sit throughbr br 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dischordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mindnumbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test ones sanity if youve still got all your marbles youll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead I watched the whole thing but am well aware that Im completely barking,0
This movie was absolutely pathetic A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead I couldnt even sit through the whole movie Emran Hashmi disappoints and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all Celina Jaitley was not bad The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris It was pretty hilarious The songs Sini Ne and its remix version were really good You can always count on Emran liplocking and lipsynching a chartbuster All in all it seems Emran doesnt have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time,0
This movie fails miserably on every level I have an idea lets take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east Maybe if were lucky theyll all be shot and killed and we wont have to ever have our time wasted by them again Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life My god I cant think of anything Ive ever seen that was this bad Id rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film Ill spit in their face and then beat them senseless Thats my two cents,0
Based on a Edgar Rice Burroughs novel AT THE EARTHS CORE provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest A Victorian scientist Dr Abner PerryPeter Cushinginvents a giant burrowing machine which he and his American partnerDoug McClureuse to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monstersbr br Cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying Instead of being a bold adventurer he comes across effeminate On the other hand McClure overacted enough to make himself also laughable Caroline Munro plays the pretty Princess Dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth Also in the cast are Godfrey James Cy Grant and Michael Crane,0
This show makes absolutely no sense Every week two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening and every week without fail they somehow stumble upon a murder Because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder right But even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder wouldnt the smart thing to do be to tell the police You know the people who can actually do something about it But every week these two fools go around polluting evidence committing crimes of their own and in some cases causing more murders Once they do miraculously solve the murders there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted All the evidence has been sabotaged And youd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two wouldnt you Yay Weve solved the murder Now like every other week lets go and confront the murderer ourselves and with no backup tell them that we know about it There is no way we could get ourselves into any danger is there Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on television and certainly the most ridiculous,0
This movie was so bad it was funny For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie a la For Your Consideration The cliffhanger scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt The script was dreadful enough but coupled with Sean Youngs terrible acting especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail complete with flashbacks while dangling off a cliff makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie I still cant believe how this thing got made First of all how did such a bad script get the green light How did star actors get attached Were they at low points in their careers Questions questions,0
Airport 4 is basically a slopped together mess for Universal Studios to try and work a new twist the Concorde supersonic airliner into their disasterinthesky formulabr br Bogged down with unintentional humor the best of which is when George Kennedy sticks his hand out of Concordes window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heatseeking missile following the aircrafts flight path and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep reboarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air Many stars in this one including Robert Wagner Sylvia Kristel Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger br br Not really related to the other Airport films,0
Supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970s Nightmare is full of bad Southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinlydisguised babe in prison movieespecially in its uncut original version Nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors in particular does a good job of making viewers hate himeven though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes Theres also a changeofpace role for the late Robert Reed who appears as the lecherous warden and Tina Louise previously Ginger of Gilligans Island made a rather believable sadistic prison guard My grade D br br,0

Insignificant and lowbrained haha 80s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind The special effects are tacky the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs The Brain takes place in a typical quietAmerican town setting where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the coolkid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet It is here that a TVguru named Dr Blake and his adorable petbrain begin their quest for nationwide mind controlling Under the label of independent thinkers a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill How cool is that Now its up to the Meadowvale teenrebel to save the world The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but thats about it Meh who needs a background in a movie like this really Theres not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil brain looks like an oversized sockpuppet The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made Bloody Birthday guilty pleasure of mine and Plague Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in ReAnimator A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudityfactor and shes obviously a great talent She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her masterpiece In her debut she was credited as runaway model and in 3 men and a baby her character is referred to as one of Jacks girls I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress,0

Resnais wow The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour The opening voiceover with old embellished intertitles was a nice touch Then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on a black white placard The camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party This is all in the first 60 secondsbr br Then the music starts A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes I speak French so I cant blame it on the subtitles Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song Then they leave and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the filmbr br Im not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time musical cacophony But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out I enduredbr br It didnt get much better Ill tell you why There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters We dont even see their faces half the time as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera People flit on off stage like moths around a lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot Its as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie With bad songsbr br The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did 1 hour was that I was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all I admit excellent But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours Not me Maybe tomorrow Ill try watching the end Aw who am I kidding I have more important things to do Im sure you do too Skip this,0
I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch Its one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for a moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just cant turn it off no matter how bad it is One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad its good and so bad its well just plain BAD its worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that its both Great middleofthenight fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag Dont even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply,0

I accept that most 50s horror arent scary by todays standards but what the hell is this When you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast Instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on Earthyeah which is what the people wantedbr br The overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beastbut the title really kills the movie Night of the Beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isnt any blood to speak ofbr br I like how the 50s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one This movie isnt the worst ive ever seen but its almost up therebr br 2 out of 10,0
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs It is definitely an awful example of a film So awful in fact that I dont even consider it a movie I describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing A thing that must be stopped at all costs My friends and I first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one Well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word Its just a cheap poorly done ripoff of Evil Dead The whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed Ive seen bad horror movies before Manos Troll 2 HOBGOBLINS shudder I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsbr br Fun fact This film is like a cockroach on steroids Much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear Kind of scary huh,0
There is a difference between a film and a movie A film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder In my time as a viewer I have seen may examples of bothbr br On September 19 I attended a screening of writerdirector Jon Satejowskis Donnybrook Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts a rough cut and the finished product of this piece I can safely say it is a movie And a student movie at that It is for lack of a better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images The visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interestedbr br Granted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog Steven Soderberghs sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind This movie however has neither The main story is weak and unfocused If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father then I feel this movie misses the point What I got out of it is that Davies main aspiration is to change the face of rock n roll However we see very little activity on his part to show this While there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode Next time SHOW dont TELL the audience Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this Also Davie doesnt look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970s he looks like hed be more comfortable in the early days of rock n roll posing as James Deans less talented brother In the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency ie the subplot involving Terrys father If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction I will consider watching Napolean Dynamite again a film I could barely make it through the first timebr br As for the above mentioned dialog scenes I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak I dont think it is When the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly overthetop outbursts These characters simply do not behave like normal rational people Working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film Al Hudsons and thats just because hes doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen A good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them However with Satejowski being so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner is the mark of a selfindulgent misguided fool Just ask Rob Schneider br br In the end we are left with a poor highschoolset knockoff of Zach Braffs amazing Garden State combined with the equally amazing Velvet Goldmine two films far more worthy of your timebr br Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this The best I can do is compliment Mr Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see However the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur This is a student movie nothing more nothing less If the movie holds any promise and lets face it at this point it isnt going to come from the acting writing or directing it is this If IF the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt dont attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you If you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called a filmbr br I am your audience and I am willing to watch,0

Sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror If you can just toetap your way through the slowpaced early scenes sometimes a real gem will present itself This unfortunately was not the case with Satans Whipbr br Written and directed by Jason Maran Satans Whip attempts to drag us along on a boring snorefest of a film with no real pay off at the end Im guessing that the black white and blue cinematography must have been for a reason however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue and I found this increasingly annoying as the film went on The story in itself is not that bad and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic This combined with the slowpacing and lack of any real red gore made Satans Whip one to forget quite quickly I will give it a 4 rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time,0
Tainted look at kibbutz lifebr br This film is less a cultural story about a boys life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general In the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves And its all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim Besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well evil br br The story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows There is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz Every charactersituation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc For example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother He treats these volunteers like trash After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasnt seen in a long time due to his military service he orders Quote Linda go take shower and I cum in two minutes br br There is one other good character in this movie a European foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend When the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapists arm He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members More hypocrisy The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act thats supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse br br The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders The mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose Its a mystery how the boys father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son br br Thats the gist of this movie One dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in I feel sorry for the guy who made this film obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs,0

Clifton Webb is one of my favorites However Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best His patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality In addition the viewer is presented with numerous hamhanded references to religious faith and US patriotism that come off as overreverent rather than genuine Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfroglike low voice unusual for someone of his age However once youve heard it youve heard it and you dont need to hear it again Unfortunately he is in the majority of the films scenes I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up Since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film There were and are so many talented child actors its a pity this film doesnt have any of them in it Still Clifton Webb in the traditional broadbrimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing,0
What an incomprehensible mess of a movie Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom and from the size of the jar hes been shot about fifty times by now and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear And youll never hear another screenplay feature the word butthorn either Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from Lethal Weapon and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier the same character he played in Red Dawn a few years earlier After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies Sadly hell probably always be remembered best as the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in Every Which Way You Can,0
WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSbr br A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St series However just two years on and I find I cant remember enough about them in order to do it I guess they couldnt have made much of an impression From what I do recall some of the sequels Dream Warriors in particular werent as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic Generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams doesnt lend itself to narrative tension But while I cannot recall much of the first five films I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddys Deadbr br An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the characters demise The fact that the movies conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the films being goes to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture wasbr br Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain Robert Englunds innowayscary interpretation booms with laughter I always thought Freddys mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe Its like Englunds crying out we know this is garbage but youre paying to see it so whos the one laughing And Im sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight Was Freddys appearance in the films always so rudimentary All he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr har har hars and thats it If this was the only Elm St film youd ever seen you wouldnt get to know the character at all Even as the character predeath in a flashback Englund plays him as a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic ie overstated misplaced and not at all funny ironybr br Acting is almost universally poor Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language Only Kananga himself Yaphet Kotto keeps his dignity And when Roseanne Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire The script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit Carlos Ricky Dean Logan opens a road map upon which the Noel Cowardlike Freddy has wittily written youre fked When prompted for the map Carlos responds well the map says were fked Who wrote the screenplay Oscar Wildebr br Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are magnified Oddly the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect Nice hearing from you Carlos quips Freddy hoping some better lines will come along Its also worth noting that dream sleep doesnt occur instaneously so being knocked unconscious wouldnt allow instant access into Freddys world Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3D finale plot logic isnt that high on the list of requirementsbr br The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series Tracy Lezlie Deane is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with shut the fk up man and a kick in the scallops And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients Freddys Dead No laughs No scares No interest No funbr br,0
I watched this movie for the hot guyand even he sucked He was the worst onewell okay I have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too he was even worse The guy wasnt that cute in the end he had the most terrible accent and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that cant stand up to his mom for the one he loves theres ever been Overall and if this makes any sense to you when I go to pick up movies at the video store I think to myself as I read the back of a movie that looks soso Well at least it cant be worse than Carolina Moon The most terrible movie and the most terrible writing acting ploteverything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips It was THE most horrid movie I will ever see with Gabriela way up there too I hated it and trust me if there was any number under 1 IMDb had for rating Id choose that in a heartbeat,0
After a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy Chainsaw massacrefeeling everything falls apartbr br SPOILER ALERT As soon as the two FBIofficers start jabbing you know they are the real killers Anyone who have seen enough of these fooledyamovies can figure this outbr br This movie is mader with one thing in mind To depict brutal murders Why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well Will this be next for us moviegoers The torture and abuse of children Whats wrong with you people Lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind,0
I cant say much about this film I think it speaks for itself as do the current ratings on here I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it I even tried to like it by watching it twice but I just couldnt I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again And Im not one to trash a movie but I truly believe this was awful It wasnt even funny in the slightest The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me All I can think of when I see one of their films nowadays is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money Amy Poehler is so very annoying toobr br Overall well I think you get my point The stars are for Walken by the way,0
I am not so old that I cant remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple times But some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cellsbr br From the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead Neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades br br If you ever saw Shakes the Clown you know how unfunny Bobcat was 15 years agothis movie is worse It was not even funny by accident It is sad pathetic and a total waste of time May Goldthwaits hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene He is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into Hollywood,0
The box is why I originally picked up this movie and the back is why I rented it But I soon learned that I had been duped I had thought this movie would be something like a Road TripEurotripAmerican Pie deal But I was wrong This movie is one of the dumbest Ive seen in a long time The unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy It appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead I cant believe National Lampoon put its name on this DONT BUY IT DONT RENT IT Dont waste 2 hours of your life on this,0
Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd subpar haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending Clue 1 for all considering seeing this turkey Sam Raimi didnt direct it Although commercials for the movie play up his involvement in truth he is one of four producers Its too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie I dont think he would ever have directed something like this that task was left to the Pang Brothersbr br The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other horror films so youll find absolutely zero original content in The Messengers What we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of Pulse a couple that could have come from The Birds one or two from The Others etc Nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comesbr br Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie In fact everyone can see the ghosts The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie Im sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent Now you know so dont be fooled Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors It simply isnt there All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow Didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling Boo All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorlymade film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house If theres any message that The Messengers delivers its Dont waste your time on this movie,0
This movie sucks ass Something about a heatwave in some European country complete trash Theres nothing going for this movie whatsoever maybe 30 seconds of sex but thats it There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off This movie is complete rash and you shouldnt subject yourself to watching it I regret it its very boring I would rate it zero but i cant No body in their right mind should see this im sure youll regret it completely i did How could they think up something this bad Even Mystery men was better MYSTERY MEN That sucks That movie wasnt worth being made complete waste of time The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored,0
Mararía really disappointed me I cant consider it as a bad movie but the development just seemed too rushed and nonbelievable for it to evoke any emotions Dr Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one cant really understand where it was born from I mean how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía Maybe once Also Mararía never appeared to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed Some of the best acting came from a role that wasnt really important to the story that of Marcial the subintelligent yet humble drunkard Of course the scenery the cultural tidbits of the Canary Islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as a solid drama,0
Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters The mad doctors nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy The results are not good This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors There isnt much zombie action in this one and the effects while adequate are nothing special You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes Watch out for some nudity and bad language,0
That this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is truly dead Am I the only one that really saw rather sleptwalked through this film This is the only movie Ive ever seen in the theater that I regret not walking out on and demanding my money back it was just that dull And I even saw Highlander 2 The Quickening at the local cinema From beginning to end Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies cast together by circumstance who eventually work together as best buddies The action what little there is is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer Thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our cinema that theres no chance for an Air America 2,0
Well theres no real plot to speak of its just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but its not in this case What else can I say about this The action when happening is inventive and theres a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper one that has to be several miles high but overall theres not much to recommend Kite Watch it if you want but youre not missing much if you skip this one,0
This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you havent seen any of the others There are the usual ingredients it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts we can watch Bo disrobing or auditioning for wet Tshirt contests quite frequently the story is just laughably idiotic and the film takes itself much too seriously And then Orang Utans in Africabr br But it has a few things going for it Bo looks great the production values sets costumes etc are quite good and this greatly enhances its camp value In a strange way it is actually quite funny simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly,0

Note to self Never ever ever again watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it Great comedian horrible seal This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world Charlie Sheen helps destroy the Navy SEAL reputation Thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies I have ever seen This is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why Charlie Sheen There are possibilities for a very passionate story here but Sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments,0

How do you take a cast of experienced wellknown actors and put together such a stupid movie Nimrod Antel has the answer Armored Six coworkers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves But just as they get to first base with their plans everything unravels quickly With a plot like this youd think it couldnt be too bad at least for an action movie However in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday kind of guys They joke they laugh have a few drinks together etc Then we suddenly learn theyre planning to rob their own business The hero Ty Columbus Short is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though hes a decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee Oh my oh my Then in the last 40 minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into moneycrazed psychos willing to butcher each other for cash In the last scenes Mike Matt Dillon goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty Its utterly unbelievable and B movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot I would say dont waste your timetoo bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture,0
I did not expect much from this film but boyoboy I did not expect the movie to be this bad Chris Rock is not showing a good act here you cant get the feeling that his caracter is real I think the movie would have been a bit better if its drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and morebetter humor was involved The movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it In the making of they dont show a single smile This is a very bad film I gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but I did never laugh,0

Despite having an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda Aside from one or two REAL stinkers Id probably watch just about anything with them in the film as I am a huge fan of Hollywoods golden age of the 1930s and 40s However no matter how much I love their films I just cant recommend this filmbr br The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort The two havent yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodels while skiing It was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but I stuck it outespecially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling In hindsight perhaps I should have just turned it off then Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help Back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and has him xrayed and nurses him back to health He in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her Despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedybr br Once home however all isnt rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy The film plays it all for laughs but frankly Fondas behaviors were really creepyspying on her and her male patients attacking or threatening ANY man she treats tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there men and women are out to steal away his wife He comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but its all supposed to be for laughs Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order But oddly she gets mad but just cant stay mad at Fonda because hes so I cant think of the right wordcreepy is all that comes to mind Later out of the blue multimillionaire Fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store Then through magical thinking he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the pastso a job apparently cures anger and suspicions When this job falls through the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after They dont go any further with the story but I assume based on Fondas character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patientsbr br The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together nor did the final Horatio Alger inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world They were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy What a creepy little film Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films,0

I was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose Inglourious Basterds due to its amazingly high IMDb rating I must say now what a disappointment I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence but I also expected a lot of witty dialog I got a huge dosage of the former but not nearly enough of the latter I felt shortchanged The ratio between violence to plot is very important and I think this movie gets it totally wrong And the plot Its that believable or really all that entertaining either Save your time and money I cant believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses,0

In sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes The director and cowriter says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy Well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil To boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile Additionally the film is not really realistic Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his exlovers son By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of convenience and a nutty exlover At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either Ismael or primarily Nora To the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael her exlover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the subplots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow balls chance in hell The actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus,0
Incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went insane leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path I know there are several versions of this and this is based on the 102 min one that I watched but I cant fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muckbr br Id heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sexnudity which honestly there isnt much of here at all and boring when there is and blood but beware its the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here Everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project Camerawork is hopelessly inept full of strange zooms failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy cheapish photo quality Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven is it day or night Are they in or outside Have they changed scenes Who is or is meant to be in the shot Editing is the final sin here making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much its tragicbr br A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan burnt and Fellinilike turkey thats only good for a few gobblelaughs and Peter OToole who makes a most memorable Tiberius Oh yes which brings us to the bigname actors Id like to line them all up one by one and just ask Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this There Ive wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time periodbr br 1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe,0
Did anyone edit this film Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes Its OK though I fell asleep watching it the first time Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time The plot is actually not the worst Ive seen but its close The acting is not the worst Ive seen eitherbut its close The production well I can honestly say that it was the worst I had ever seen in my life Not trying to be spiteful but Unhinged could have used some more productionbr br Please dont think Im a hater of horror films or even that I didnt enjoy this film I just felt I was laughing at the film much more than I felt I was laughing along with it The gruesome moments were not too poorly done but could have been done better even with a shoestring budgetbr br Characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored all together twist ending was pretty bad and the exposition took forever without exposing muchbr br Id recommend avoiding this moviebr br 110,0
Most of the comments on this movie are positive so I thought I would try and redress the balance I came out of this movie wondering what was going on I now know and still consider it to be a poor movie I intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious I was glad that I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back Movie reviewers and critics love this movie which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film The 8 rating this movie has is so misleading In 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as The Godfather The film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isnt enough to save the film nor are the lesbian scenes,0
Pepe le Moko played by Charles Boyer is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all For le Moko although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time a place he cant leave because the moment he does he knows hell be arrestedbr br Boyers performance was good and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar He captures the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time The movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which Ill mention two First was the idea that the police wouldnt enter the Casbah That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly So neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police wouldnt enter nor the statement by Inspector Slimane also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko hardened criminal mastermind that he was could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby Hedy Lamarr to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her essentially giving himself up I understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison the Casbah only to find real freedom in his capture because hes shot and killed by the police I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trapbr br This is worth watching for Boyer and to a lesser extent Calleia but the story is disappointing and inconsistent 310,0
You should never ever even consider to watch this movie It is absolutely awful This isnt an overstatement It is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring It is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one They writer hasnt been able to pull it off in a good waybr br If youd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch Its not worth listeningp There are so many great movies out there and if I could choose one this would be the last movie I would pick But all in all its your choice br br Enjoy,0
Tell the truth Im a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie And after having seen it I was really a disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of moviebr br Im surprise at this movie all completely it is like a kids movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing Im not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my accountbr br Synopsis The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freakbr br Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done The story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame And havent we already seen the same characters play by Mc Lovin in so many other movies like Sasquatch Gang I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleepbr br Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay And the acting is soso as expected when youre watching this type of movie And the direction what do one expect This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer and that movie also sucks But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous moviebr br Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie Cant really see any point why I should recommend this to anyonebr br Pros Elizabeth Bank Two topless scenesbr br Cons Not funny dreadful story nudity and kids do not mix togetherbr br Rating 3510 Grade F,0
Like the previous poster I am from northern Vermont and I was inclined to like this film However not since Red Zone Cuba have I seen such a confusing plot The things the people to bootleg make no sense Two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car Uhm why Then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guys hideout in a luxury Packard Wouldnt just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense Then parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch the four fall asleep When they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out of course theyre spotted and shot at losing some of their precious cargo in the process Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border Again why I am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the US Canada Border Patrol which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now br br And dont get me started on the last half hour which made no sense whatsoeverbr br The only good thing I can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years,0
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS This movie was the worst movie ever I couldnt even watch it all it was so bad This film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot This was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times Not even the gore in the film was good The shootings were fake and the acting was worse Please do yourself a favor and skip this one If you see it at the rental store then run the other way There is nothing good about this film at all If you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch Night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head If you want to see an OK new cheesy movie then watch Scarecrow I rate this movie a 02 out of 10 Thats how horrible this film really is THE WORST MOVIE EVER,0
Recap Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of Antarctica The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica Julian Rome a former SETIworker is brought in to decipher the message Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly Soon the object is in the open The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity It is decided to open the object but just before that is done Julian decodes the signal Do not open But too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth The first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff And Washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth So a Russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarcticabr br Comments The movie holds a few surprises One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes It is never really explained why Washington know so much why Washington is able to command Russian submarines why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language and obviously chose English why But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus send their Do not open message encoded And finally the end is as open as an end can bebr br The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too goodbr br 310,0

Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix Id have a couple of hours of my life back Im frankly suspicious when I see that a films director also wrote it In this case according to the credits the same guy was writter and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production There were a few interesting moments eg Judy Tenutas scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting Judyism which led me to rate this two stars rather than one Those moments however were few and far between and I almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence I admit I went back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once Id seen the whole thing Nope though I at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later The spinning camera technique was overused and essentially pointless I found myself talking to the TV screen What or For goodness sake get ON with it Not recommended,0

Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV it was always the pan and scan version which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie AndrewsBlake Edwards opus I decided to purchase and watch it once and for allbr br Boy what a terrible film Its so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong Looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals MARY POPPINS SOUND OF MUSIC THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself CAMELOT MY FAIR LADY etc because Hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough So Blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy storywar movieromanceslapstick comedymusical DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassingbr br Mind you the version on the DVD is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop In releasing the DVD Edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version The film moves along with no idea of what it is We are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going What kind of spy is Lili How powerful is she Was she ever responsible for someones death Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews Things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love Why does Julie fall for Hudson Why him and not other men she got involved with There should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings Theres no catalyst in this storybr br One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews and Edwards previous successes The best or worst example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC Its no wonder he removed it from the DVD Back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation There are other plot elements directly inspired by AndrewsEdwards other films The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE The musical moment Ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julies MARY POPPINS persona which is turned raunchy with Julie doing a striptease in the act The ending birds eye view of Julie running towards Hudsons plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSICbr br The whole thing is confusing Julie plays a singer born from a German father and British mother who lives in England but sings her English songs in Paris You never know exactly where the story takes place Some moments are just badly edited Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in midsentence Im like what happened herebr br The comedy bits are unfunny and cringeworthy Every scene with the French police are pathetic Wheres Peter Sellers when you really need him The action is stupid beyond belief When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train Hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing Lili in the process Brilliant Whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning Thats one slow moving train there br br The musical moments The beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason I gave this film 3 stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end Speaking of redundant did we really need to see a cancan dance Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too The Girl in no mans land is OK even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spyingbr br The whole project is listless and without energy The romance is 100 unbelievable Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene Julie looks dazed like shes on Valium But what really kills this illconceived project is Julie playing a German spy Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision As much as I like Julie shes no Greta Garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI Funny enough even if Julie plays a German spy she still comes across as cloying and cutebr br How bad is DARLING LILI Even after 37 years since its release Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release,0
This series made for Televisión Española TVE is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968 primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest sonbr br Based on a background of historical events such as the May 1968 student uprising in France the decaying Franco regime the war in VietNam the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainmentbr br Generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times as it should be stated anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other thingsbr br The best thing that can be said of this series is Ana Duatos rôle as mother of three children she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well manifesting that peculiar Spanish penchant especially noticeable among women of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart without any resorting to the use of the brain As we say in Spain common sense is one of the least common senses Imanol Arias offers very little apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series Indeed as an actor he should not be trusted in anything which is not a TV series His resources are too limited however his part as father of the workingclass household is not at all badbr br Not really recommendable for other audiences even Spanishspeakers in Latin America the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary Spanish history such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references It is even probable that certain situations which cause a few Spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers,0
I want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie The acting was horrific I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent DOnofrio I will never look at them the same again Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise Everyone knows they never could act Thankfully only Dan attempted an accent His accent was a disaster as expected I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read,0

A truly muddled incomprehensible mess Most things in the film look more or less like 1987 but then there are futuristic things just thrown in like the policemans ray gun And that car The director seemed to be in love with colored lights The only really notable performance was the girl who played Valerie but since there was no cast listing I dont know which actress that was This one is worth missing Grade F,0
Im a big fan of surrealist art but this film by Bunuel with some ideas from Dali left me cold Bunuel had a lifelong grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways This is one of the silliest almost like what youd expect from a smartaleck 18yearold in film class The last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nosethumbing at religionbr br If you read the scholars regarding this slowpaced occasionally amusing film its all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression If that is indeed the point then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies Is this behavior the churchs fault for interrupting his lovemaking or is he just a jerk I vote for the latter I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blamebr br There are a few moments where you might cry Aha surrealism a cow in a bed a giraffe falling out a window a poor model a man shredding a feather pillow a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or a mud pithard to tell in BW The rest is forgettable selfindulgence Unfortunately Bunuel was still chasing the same bogeymen through the rest of his career Viridiana Discreet Charm If youre interested in seeing surrealism on the screen check out Jean Cocteaus early work,0
This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970s hippie mentality in a nut shell and bores us in the process Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups A naive young hippy played by the waiflike Kay Lenz hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys and then one day she meets the ridiculous Holden already in old age hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor and she decides that she is in love with him If you think that is superficial the whole film encapsulates such scenes She keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him it wears thin and really quick I couldnt help but laugh throughout the film Its obvious shes just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit A corny offering of music from the 70s is also spread through the film Avoid this if you can Grade D,0

Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religionphilosophy The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrongbr br Examples Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion How Well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time Also the act of observation seems to affect the event Solid particles can pass through barriers All of this so far is accurate But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it This is complete poppycock Instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief Also youd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against itbr br This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by Marlee Maitlan About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and selfhate There may be some truth to that but Quantum physics has nothing to do with itbr br Plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays Instead of wasting your time with this dreck I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hourlong episodes Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation,0

I am so disappointed This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy Here was the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again the neurotic upperclass Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses Woody Ive seen these characters already Ive seen the storyline from you ten times already Where did your creativity go You need to open your eyes and look around you The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall and you need to change along with itbr br There are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over againbr br When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out it does nothing for me because now Ive come to expect his old standby the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating Depressing and same old same oldbr br If Woody wants to win his fans back then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated not insulted,0
This movie is all ultralightweight fluff predictable from beginning to end As a Don Knotts vehicle The Incredible Mr Limpet was much better with Knotts character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant His performance there was toned down with none of his trademark goggleeyed stare although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile much as Bob Denver did Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles assuming they were simply typecast It was probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the highpitched voice John Ritter whom Knotts worked with in Threes Company was able to transcend his genre branching out successfully into dramatic roles like The Dreamer of Oz but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in Pleasantville Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in Airplane and Police Squadbr br Theres also no way the then43 yearold Knotts could pass for a 35 yearold as his character insisted he was It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at 38 playing the collegeage Forrest Gumpbr br The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget very much looking like a hastilyfilmed TV episode Its especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where Roy goes after hes fired Its unlikely even a preschooler would be fooled by the Mayberrylike soundstage artificialitybr br Even viewing this strictly as a childrens movie its very disappointing Its not because it lacks action or special effects although it does The pace is much too slow the situations repetitive How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap with breakneck gags otherwise you risk boring them and any adults in the theater as well Movies even kids movies have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written Disneys The Love Bug for instance at least had some interesting race action,0
In all honesty I havent seen this film for many years but the few times I have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze I cant risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way You have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days I dont know if its available on home video or not but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults,0
I watched this movie based on the good reviews here and I wont make that mistake againbr br The first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy but you dont see what it is Flashback 12hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen When the ending is finally reveled you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesnt happen and means nothing to what you have been watching The only connection these people have is that they have all had a bad daybut even that continuity gets lost in the boredombr br If this was supposed to be a Crash clone its a complete failure,0
I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons br br 1 Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo and Ill better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodles head in my bed br br 2 Surprise winners No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor Genuine applause or Roman Polanski for best director Genuine jeers and boos but they won br br Last years award ceremony wasnt too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasnt the best in the trilogy FELLOWSHIP was much better but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics Obviously they are Im sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers br br Chris Rock wasnt too bad but hes no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the minor Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats Theres no such thing as a minor Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design theyre as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasnt for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history As for the awards themselves br br Best Supporting Actress Cate Blanchett No great surprise for a competitive category br br Best Supporting Actor Morgan Freeman No real complaints since Freeman is one of Americas greatest living character actors br br Best Actor Jamie Foxx Most predictable award of the night Yawn br br Best Actress Hilary Swank Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night br br Best Director Clint Eastwood Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because hed never won one Actually Im glad about this because if he didnt deserve it for TAXI DRIVER RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didnt deserve it for THE AVIATOR br br Best Film MILLION DOLLAR BABY Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDBs controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off br br What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they havent done in the past I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawds sake And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts,0

This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isnt The movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated If the whole movie had been animated it might have been good I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads for it and the only reason I did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest This is the first and probably only movie I have ever walked out on On a scale of 110 I give this movie a score of 100,0
Okay Ive watched this movie twice now I have researched it heavily on the net I have asked several people on there opinions I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic Carmilla a book that this movie is supposed to be based on I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it As the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the bookbr br Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father Mr De Lafontaine They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully One day they get a letter from the General a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon Meanwhile a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter Carmilla for several months Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with a strange illness Who is this mysterious Carmilla And just what has she to do with Lauras condition and the Generalbr br I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are I even have a catchy name and would have a jingle too but I cant be bothered with that Its called the this movie doesnt make any sense gamebr br All you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening I mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely completebr br It will have to answer such questions as br br Why can vampires walk around in day lightbr br Why are they all lesbiansbr br Why is a girl called Bob and why does she shoot herselfbr br When is the movie a dream and when is it realbr br Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelidbr br Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is a zombie toobr br And why does he then let a girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his carbr br And then let her drive off alone with his daughter in a stolen carbr br What the hell is the asylum scene all aboutbr br What the hell is the green goo all aboutbr br Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nursebr br Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombiesbr br What is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does Jenna know thatbr br In fact sod it its just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie toobr br I have my plot and I have to admit it is not quite there but it is a pretty good effortbr br In Conclusionbr br Vampires vs Zombies has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel How Why What the hell is going on,0
This wouldve been a great silent film The acting really is good at least in a Look Ma Im Doing Really Big Acting sort of waybr br Everything is HUGE Every line is PROFOUND Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDYbr br Mostly I felt like gagging Yet like any train wreck I couldnt tear my eyes away This dialogue mightve worked on the stage although I doubt it On the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic workbr br If you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie Be prepared to wait however For all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pacebr br This script mustve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves It simply doesnt work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camerabr br IMDB does us a great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computercontrolled weighted score Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1br br Characterdriven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isnt character development Your characters must have a motivation Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development Thats a plot contrivancebr br Stay away from this movie Or at the very least watch it muted Perhaps youll get some amusement from all the armwaving the characters dobr br Oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see James Woods in all his dangly male lookatme Imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof man glorybr br Dont say you werent warned,0
This movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies The unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay The orderlies kiss I watched this in a DVD version and I have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the DVD case after all and it goes on like that Had I seen this in a movie theater I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy While it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbr br Brilliant brains can MAKE anything funny people like Ernst Lubitsch Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved that fact But you have to know the mechanics I suppose Director and coscriptwriter Dani Levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example Do not get me wrong some people can MAKE that funny Dani Levy cant not for me anywaybr br The main problem I have with this movie is that I cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave I could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox Jew from West Germany one a third class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany so strongly disliked each other They are both rather bland characters Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin But even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterbr br The acting is not bad Udo Semel I actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor Helmut Kohl a lighter version than of a venerable Orthodox Jew The direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler Oi Vai,0
This story about three women is a very sensitive study about Muriël Charlotte Van Den Eynde the youngest Laura Els Dottermans who is about 37 and Martha Frieda Pittors the oldest who is the mother of Muriël They live together in the same building They have different expectations of life The vital Laura wants a child Muriël comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl In fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something for instances an accident which could dramatize this story As times goes on you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case so one is left with a feeling of emptiness,0
First and foremost I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury Its the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later It was one of his best books with you know Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine I as just hoping that this movie would be all right It had lots of chances with a great cast like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce And Bradbury even wrote the script himself And on top of all that it has PAM GRIERbr br How could it failbr br There may be spoilers withinbr br First of all it was dumbed down Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum All the visuals from the bookgone Everything that made you squirmgonebr br And then theres the acting Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act And this bugged me a lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 Their strong friendship wasnt addressed It was more like they were acquaintaces br br Youd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr Halloway and Mr Dark But here its like they just dont care All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something This is far from being some of their best performances br br Pam Grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wasnt well pulled off Shes a lot less evil and doesnt have the presence as she did in the book br br And everything that was left out of the book The ballon night chase the marking of Jims house the real death of Mr Dark what happened to Mr Coogan on the merrygoround the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more br br And the special effects were bad even for the 80s The merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasnt really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything br br I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood boil Dont see this movie but read the book Its a classic of Bradbury,0

I never fell asleep during a movie Never This movie did the impossiblebr br While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts this movie was a lesson in over abundance As in the movie was 30 minutes too long It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement The acting was absolutely terrible bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to adlib something called a script Did these people even get any direction Were they coaxed to be boring and dull Either therory wouldnt surprise mebr br What was even worse was the rather unscary makeup involved with the creatures from the other side Either way they all stunk Dont watch this film Thats all I can say unless youre an insomniac,0
Originally harped as a sequel to The Slumber Party Massacre series this film falls flat on its face with a new title First off if you are going to include the word massacre in your films title you better deliver This one certainly does not There is no gore no on screen murders and no chainsaw as the box art would lead you to believe Instead we get a paper thin overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game only to be offed one by one Again this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit Why directors especially those doing directtovideo flicks are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me Now I am not a huge fan of excessive gore but come onwhy else would anyone rent a movie called Cheerleader Massacre Besides that problem the film suffers from a shotonahomevideocamera cheapness It looks cheap sounds cheap and the actors arent all that good It tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be but even that fails The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess Folks if you run across this film walk away and go find the original Slumber Party Massacre 2 out of 10,0

Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films I have ever seen In no way shape or form would I recommend it to anyoneunless youre trying to put your kids to sleep or God forbid give someone an aneurysm If I could go back in time and do one thing I would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters Why Days of Heavens plot is simple but extremely vague Long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with The climax of the story does not touch you by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone The only things working are your eyes and unfortunately your ears who must listen to the sound of Linda the little girl in the story who talks like a man I am now dumber for seeing this movie Dont let it happen to you,0
Yes indeed it could have been a good movie A love biangle sorry for the poetical license but is not a triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told The image is sometimes weird sometimes OK the picture looks crowded and narrowsighted The sound needs more attention it usually does in Romanian movies the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action About the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer The acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical Its a picture for adults told by the children Bother only if extremely curious,0
This movie is lame and not funny at all The plot doesnt even make sense Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie Im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing Who are these people and what are they doing Basically this is a gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are a bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing I didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal I dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid I cant think of any part of the movie that was good,0

I had been amazed by director Antals Kontroll back in 2003 His first American project Vacancy was less impressive but a decent start Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a B movie br br Its a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either br br What you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money If you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre left with what could have been a below average directtovideo featuring Van Damme or Seagal br br This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time,0
First of all the reason Im giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a moviebr br I was initially all fired up at reading one posters comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave the performance of his career To me it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment Then I thought to myself what else has Stevens done So I checked and you know that person was absolutely right In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his careerbr br If you like Columbo see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last,0

Down at the Movie Gallery I saw a flick I just had to see It looked like a fun lowbudget horroractionwestern that I could get into Yeah I knew it would suck but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs Only a few laughs were to be found This was an extremely stupid movie It begins with a bounty hunter our protagonist who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film He looksacts like he could take on Chuck Norris but he cant His dialogue sucks too Anyway he goes into a village shoots some zombies You could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 35 minutes to reload or watch some zombies At least the zombies look cool So anyway some people get shot some zombies die and in the end everyone is dead except our main character who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people,0
I thrive on cinemabut there is a limit A NAME isnt enough to make A MOVIE The beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet But we remain hungry or angry till the end Things are getting so confused that I admit that I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE END or was there an end to this nonesense The opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed Next,0
Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems nonetheless to be regarded as a perfect catch by any woman that runs across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also coproduced the film Hes a hero whom its very difficult to empathize with so the movie is in trouble right from the start However its troubles dont end there It has the production values of a TVmovie check out that head made of clay or something near the end and the ending cheats in a way that I cant reveal in case anyone wants to see the movie highly unlikely Lets just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows 12,0
I decided to watch this one because its been nominated for Oscar this year I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and disappointed First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really annoyingbr br i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is thisbr br American military machine people who makes money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something sort of patrioticbr br why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of lovingwarlikeadrug Oh please come on what a bore br br watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall,0
Oh my goodness I would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance this soon but here it is Armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headacheinducing style sorry I have no other words for it Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to reevaluate an entire genre that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little betterbr br Now not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it Right from the main titles nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from Se7en I was under the impression that something didnt smell quite right As soon as the movie started with a series of corny wannabe hip quickcuts full of gory images and bombastic colors I knew where that smell was coming frombr br It turns out that two policemen or rather policeman Jim Renart Michael Paré and policewoman Dorothy Smith Jennifer Rubin are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver A serial killer known as Monkey Killer what a menacing chilling nickname uh for his working methods has killed quite a lot of people You see this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and tongues out of his victims So far six eyes six ears and three tongues In very ingenious fashion Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people well because he probably wants to complete the number 666 So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick Casper Van Dien a young successful goodlooking businessman with a dreadful temper And thats where the ripoff of American Psycho kicks inbr br So we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet Along the way to that a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory Renart goes in the back of the disco club because well just because the script tells us its a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach Renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard of again Does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealisticbr br Anyway after another murder Gerrick turns in as a witness but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer In typical Basic Instinct fashion Smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identitybr br I wont spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment there are contradictions some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly cant imagine how anyone could not laugh at itbr br At 87 minutes Sanctimony is really pushing it You never care about one single character because they are all so flat not to mention boring that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them You are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place The acting ranges from average Van Dien to downright atrocious Rubin and most of the supporting cast the music is abysmal generic techno and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen Of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nuditybr br 310,0
This film was basically set up for failure by the studio One Anne Rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio Two they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour moviebr br I maintain the only way for these two books Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned to work in a live action form would be through a miniseries First off the the Vampire Lestat alone takes place from the 1700s to the 1980s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character Lestat The entire book Vampire Lestat sets up the events of the second part Queen of the Damned Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyedbr br Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with Akashas plans Marius did not make Lestat Lestat did not love Jesse or make her Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light Marius was not after David nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong BASICALLY same names different storybr br If they wanted to make a vampire movie fine Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine But dont piggie back into the theaters off the success of Rices great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to lovebr br If you havent read the books you wont understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted That being said I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it Catch 22 must see it will hate it,0
Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more even from a score of 58 IMDb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting Dont waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedybr br I give this 210 it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isnt,0
What a frustrating movie A small Southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces as anyone who has read anything by Carson McCullers already knows This does none of that Instead the writers settled for cutesy twinkles cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama The thing looks like a madeforTV movie and was directed with no particular distinction but its hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interestingbr br The most frustrating aspect though is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with thiswell theres no other word for itdrivel A tragic waste of talent in particular that of the great Stockard Channing,0
This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s Jack Pearl radios Baron Munchausen as well as Jimmy Durante However 712 decades later its being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pittsbr br As for the Stooges this is a film from there very early daysbefore MGM had any idea what to do with the team At this point they were known as Ted Healy and his Stooges as Healy was the front man Fortunately for the Stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on himyoull see what I mean and the rest is history Within a year they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of Buster Keaton Laurel and Hardy Abbott and Costello and others In fact up until they left for Columbia MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film rolesincluding acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY And oddly in this film they didnt act as a teamthey just did various supporting roles such as Larry playing the pianobr br This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle When they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety showpunctuated by scenes with the leads here and there As for Pearl I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome As for Durante I never knew what the public saw in himas least as far as his films are concernedhe was loud andloud He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keatons career to make this film Together Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor and Vaudevillestyle routines that tend to fall rather flatbr br In this film the Stooges they didnt yet have the right chemistry Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd What they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though diehard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of seeing everything Stoogeeven the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curlybr br Overall the film is rather dull and disappointing However there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess At about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing Look carefully as this is Walter Brennan in a role youd certainly never expect Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the Clean as a Whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film This song and dance number is clearly an example of a socalled PreCode scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the Production Code was strengthened Despite the word Clean in the title its a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything Its quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s Finally at the 63 minute mark see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades See the film youll see that I mean,0
When Carol Vanessa Hidalgo starts looking into her brothers death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes The closer she gets to the truth the more of a threat she becomes to her sisterinlaw Fiona Helga Line and the rest of the local Satanists Theyll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy waysbr br If youre into sleazy Satanicthemed movies Black Candles has a lot to offer The movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic softcore sex One scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed Unfortunately all the sleaze in the world cant save Black Candles Most of the movie is a total bore Other than the one scene Ive already mentioned the numerous sex scenes arent shocking and certainly arent sexy The acting is spotty at best Even genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance The plot really doesnt matter Its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together Im only familiar with one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz Compared with his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror Black Candles comes off as amateurish 310 is about the best I can do,0
I had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode It was dumbed down to such an extent I doubt if I learned a single thing The graphics were rudimentary Any small idea was repeated ad nauseum Contrast this to the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan That had a good musical theme There was NO music coming from these infernal 10dimensional Strings,0
This movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief It should be remade with a better script director and casting service The worst problem is the acting You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand Richard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work The actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at allthey are inconsistent and unbelievable Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English The casting is ludicrous Why have children of an African merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel has pronounced African features including an obviously dyed blond fro Its as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color Its just so weird This could be a great movie and should be remade but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors There are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction,0

This is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts As a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr Huston should have been proud of making However the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of PreCode films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put outeven if they arent married and even if their partner IS br br The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI In the process she meets a scalawag Bruce Cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman However Miss Dunne does NOT want him back as she realizes hes not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth While all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded toalmost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this timebr br Surprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 14 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned ittacking it on to still another film In this second phase of the film Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate And as a result of all this violence Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writerbr br But then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the womens prison reform business goes by the wayside Dunne meets a judge Walter Huston who is married but he desperately wants her Now throughout the film Dunne is portrayed as a very good girleven though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot she was more or less tricked into it But now single Irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man He tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business BUT while shes pregnant with his love child hes indicted for being a crooked judge He assures her hes innocent but hes convicted and it sure sounds like hes a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune Then in the final moments of the film Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released The film then endsbr br So we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like I gathered that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships This really undoes all the positives about Dunnes character and its really hard to imagine anyone liking the film A strong womens rights advocate might easily be offended at how weakminded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect With a decent rewrite this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull PreCode film,0
This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made Everything about itacting directing script cinematographyis dreadful The alien a human in sparkly suit claims to be from a nearby universe one assumes the scriptwriter meant galaxy but didnt bother to get a dictionary to check his terms A better title for the film would be It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances The plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent The humans are all given magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot Any thought to the passage of time is ignored Now its a couple days after meeting the alien then BAM all of a sudden theres only a couple hours left until zero hour Do yourself a favor and miss this movie You will make yourself stupider for having watched it The ending is particularly silly and should have been accompanied by someone going TaDa as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad youll get cancer watching it If you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself enemies of freedomhonestly laughing youre retarded,0
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirtmirrors eating nonants and conquering the world with a voiceover narrative then this is the movie for you Basically a couple of scientists working out of a biodome communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination Throughout the movie the two scientists and a girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their disposal computers green dye and horrid acting but to no avail I guess they just couldnt afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quicklybr br The title of the movie Phase IV is something of a mystery This is not a spoiler but Phase I starts right after the opening credits whereas you dont reach Phase IV until the end credits roll Apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed Phases 1 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report Hang in there buddy Only 1 more phase until final credits As a MST3K episode this one wasnt very good for two reasons 1 This one is from the Season 0 on KTMA when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons and 2 This movie is so bad not even JTB can lighten it up There are one or two Gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 Gamera moviesbr br The movie does have a tricksurprise ending but I was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me,0
From director Barbet Schroder Reversal of Fortune I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class and I recognised the leading actress so I tried it despite the rating by the critics Basically cool kid Richard Haywood Half Nelsons Ryan Gosling and Justin Pendleton Bullys Michael Pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie The Hyena Mayweather Sandra Bullock with new partner Sam Kennedy Ben Chaplin who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene eg nonrelating hairs The plan doesnt seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can sway them away Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills Chris Penn as Ray Feathers RD Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst DA Al Swanson I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcocks Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable Adequate,0

this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors so what went wrong i dont know and simply i dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and coworker out of his fathers company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twistsdevices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film,0

Its rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product wasbr br I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the filmmakers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager We only hear from other Palestinians in prison I understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peacebr br I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bombers parents and her angry and closedminded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control It is more realistic in my mind to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the landbr br I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative Also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side Ultimately it is a poor documentary and a poor film I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heartwrenching and sad subject matter,0
Relentless like one of those loud action movies The entire cast seems to be on speed I didnt quite get the directors intentions if any I wonder if shes ever seen a Stanley Donen Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical Structure please This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba The costumes the unflattering photography unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself No chemistry with her friends Christine Baranski and Julie Walters think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and youll understand what I was hoping for I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth The audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably its just me,0

First off I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm I read it with my 9th grade class and it was great We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial The movie was so disappointing to me The movie cuts out some characters and misses a lot of the main points of the book It skips around a lot and doesnt explain anything in detail If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book they would be confused The most disappointing thing in this movie to me was the ending The ending in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of melting together but instead the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs To sum up I dont think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book,0
This movie was extremely boring I only laughed a few times I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatners name on the cover Its all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets a prostitute She takes him to a club called the Playground where he befriends several pimps When mayor Tony Gold Shatner decides to take over the pimp business Lil Pimp must lay down for his homiesbr br The animation isnt very good in this It looks like it was made with Macromedia which Im sure it was It doesnt suck its just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years The humor in this is not very good I didnt think any of it was funny,0
I was disgusted by this movie No it wasnt because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art It shows one piece of art work that she did Judith Beheading Holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trialbr br I dont know if you understood this from the movie probably not Tassi was not a noble character He RAPED Artemisia It was not love it was rape He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured According to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew Artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again Its truebr br I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about Dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie I encourage you to do some research Artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art workbr br Dont see the movie but find out the true story of Artemisia,0
What an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel I do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original This version is no different I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy has got to be the worst casting decision EVERanyway back to this version It aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style It succeeds in both but high art it is nit Throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybeThe direction was average and the editing abysmal Worse than the old Quincy Deepak Verma does a great turn as Hindley and is in fact one of Britains wasted talents The part of Heath was played with great charm and belief and I think that the casting is the strongest point of this project Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had Its clear that he was a director for hire and didnt instill the project with the passion that it deserved,0
I just dont get some of the big premises of this episode that Miranda is so remarkable and that theres anything so ugly it would make you insane Someone here made the remark that maybe its the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness Miranda is just a jerk The episode is slow inconsistent and way too talky I also dont quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador why doesnt the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be Theres one part I do like when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience Overall I love TOS and even at its lamest Ill always tune in This episode though mmm I wouldnt purchase it except for a used copy under 3,0

Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films The film delivers the spellcasting special effects that one can expect but fails painfully on all other fronts The actors all play extremely silly caricatures You have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny The plot is predictable and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow Towards the end the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films including shabby largerthanlife special effects and a well yet another ghost with a Godzilla head Maybe I would have grinned if I was expecting campbr br It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula They wont be able to do it again the cash cow is now dead as a dodo,0

First let me just comment on what I liked about the movie The special effects were fantastic and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game There that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film In fact I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I cant even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing br br I have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where Loiss 5 yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of Superman When the crying superchild throws a piano at Lexs henchman to save his mother I almost got up and left the theater Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child Its been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit br br My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space It doesnt take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out whats wrong with that I dont know how many comic books Brian Singer has read but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Supermanrelated projects ever again The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas Thats not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground br br My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a Godlike Jorel sent to Earth to be a savior Jorel wasnt allwise he was just a scientist And he didnt send his son to earth to be a savior he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode Ill buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christs primary weakness Furthermore the crucifixion scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until Im too braindead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future They might as well rename this movie Superman Returns the Passion of the Christbr br And speaking of Luthor my last major complaint has to do with Singers depiction of Lex Luthor Lex Luthor is a shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world The man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns as well as all the previous Superman movies is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous Superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty Maybe Singers next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show ZAM WHAP POWbr br To summarize I dont know what I hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews Everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion is wrong I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you havent already Dont see it dont buy it when it comes out on DVD dont rent itbasically dont contribute any money towards it in any way This movie does not deserve to make any money In fact I think that for every person that sees this movie Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars If youre a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and youll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time,0
I am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad It reminds me of a cgrade porn movie with one major difference no pornbr br The story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul Maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable At the very least the pacing should have been picked upbr br While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it Many of the action scenes were just pointlessbr br It was a complete waste of my time,0
Im the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season from the b grade to the Hollywood but this movie was something different i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasnt to good compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz quite good and IceT in new Jack and SVU great the scene where Corrupt IceT kills the wanna be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both IceT and the other dude this kills the Jamaican however IceT is unharmed very similar to Ices other movie Urban Menace which stars both of these actors were Snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon When MJ Silkk gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thighWITH OUT BLOOD and when MJ confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend Benny was weird Benny isnt introduced in this movie and the scene isnt in the film it does hold weight to the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes u scratch your head wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesnt mention what happen 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghettowhich plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks word widewas a good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was reused thousands of times and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed not wearing a helmet and running into my Latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was OK tho but me being from poverty i love hood films however if u dont love em like i do Dont WATCH IT only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars and my love of the genrebr br Nathaniel Purez,0
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game HUGE fan It still holds a place in my top10 games list of all time The story line was new fresh A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on or so i thoughtbr br Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise see Doom The Movie and many morebr br The Video Game begins as the player Jack Carver awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier Jack then finds a communication device where Harlan Doyle guides him across islands shipwrecks jungles installations and VOLCANOES to find his lady friend Valerie Constantine all the wile battling mutated super soldiers and genetically enhanced animalsbr br The Movie plays out very very differently 1 Theres a needless 30 mins 13 of the movie of backstory before we even get to the boat blowing up scene 2 Jack then walks onto the beach kills some goons then drives off Nothing like the game 3 There is no communicator with Doyle on the other end 4 The Modified Soldiers look like albinos with singlets on And there was no mutated monkeylike creatures jumping out of the bushes A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot 5 There is no sun filled beach scenes no aircraft carrier no communications stations on huge cliffs LITTLE reference to any ingame contents charactersitemsvehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all 6 The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building 7 Theres an Ending scene where everyone except Krieger live happily ever after WHAT THEbr br I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs If you are a Gamer you will HATE this movie will all your soul It is a movie clearly intended for males so girls stay away So if your a male 1229 years of age have never played Farcry and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting booksgames to the cinema then this is for you,0
Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywoodbr br Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation 911 changed everything It changed our perception of security It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity Most importantly and devastatingly it changed our worldbr br However I cant not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry I am at the careless blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid wordofmouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press Hollywood has sunk to a new low Even lower than the lowdown bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty Behind it all is Uwe Boll I am very angry at this movie How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post911 world Howdarethey br br To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength Remember Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person Think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacksbr br Ask yourself if you have a soulbr br Think Remember Respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all,0
You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed Thats why movies like Fast and the Furious Dhoom Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones We live on a tiny island and I cannot fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 tax when they reach our shores and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one Not only that the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear lest they reach the seabr br And these movies are relatively easy to make Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic For once those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long cant compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these Of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame however they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park The guy sitting beside me I swear he wet his pants every time his dream cars appear and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moansbr br So there we have it the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie With the Fast and the Furious franchise the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage as does the GT Here the Ford GT takes on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification that even Im impressed alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos Porshe Carerra GTs Koenigsegg CCXs and every car out there that has wings for doors But seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time theyre mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment I mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the apex of motoring but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow they do so because they canbr br Theres no story in Redline just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator mind you tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steering wheels gear shifts always shifting up and not down all these while having the actors make pretend that theyre the baddest asses with an engine snarling and giving each other dirty looks Not a very tall order for an actor and thats why we get the most woeful performances ever with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkidsbr br The heroine yes it made a statement that girls can drive Natasha a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds a girl with model looks who dont mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil who has racing pedigree within her and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts lubricants and going for rides Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous Eddie Griffin she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle Everything else well like I said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to racebr br And its almost always the same as theres very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker Sun Kang and of course the star it created Vin Diesel Redline had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where its one man one car and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegasbr br If not for the cars then this movie seriously is a piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action Strictly for the car fans or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines,0
Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when Im picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy itit made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul,0
Have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions Well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced Embeth Davidtzs character is not mysterious just wooden and Kenneth Branagh doesnt succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to havebr br The bottom line obvious plot onenote performances unlikeable characters and grotesque Southern accents employed by British actors,0
br br Im not sure who decides what category a movie fits into but this movie is NOT a horror movie As for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow I was especially disappointed with the ending thoughbr br spoilerbr br Tell me why on Earth does she run over to her uncles home without at least calling the detective or the police first She knows exactly whats going on at that point plus she has a video tape as proof Instead she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying I know everything I have proof You didnt expect proof did you Then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if hes going to harm her Well DUH Of course hes going to harm you idiot you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything What a dumb ending,0
I gave this a 1 There are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for Total mayhem Everyone gets killed or nearly so I am tired of cross hairs and changing views I cannot give the plot away Convoluted and insane If I had paid to see this I would demand my money back I wish reviews were more honest,0
This film is really vile It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s80s and puts it into a school context Im not saying that urban crime wasnt a problem for a lot of people or that schools werentarent problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case its not a case of social issues but a white uppermiddle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol And of course he knows how to play the system Does that sound familiar Yes This turd is pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work Its disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment This belongs in the same category as trash like Exterminator Death Wish 25 and so on and so on The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this,0
What a horrible horrible film The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time Not that I saw much I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves Meryl Streep was awful as usual How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have Aidan Quinns talents were as so often totally wasted And who told Gloria Estefan she could act Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school The kids werent even cute Just written in to suit the appalling script Aaargh Wes Craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one,0
Motocrossed was fun but it wasnt that great I guess I just didnt understand a lot of the Motocross racing lingo and there was A LOT of that in the film The plot wasnt what I expected from the Disney Channel previews so that could account for some of my disappointment,0
Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood now he wants to broaden his horizons and SPOILER needs a family member in order to do itbr br A failure as a horror movie because it simply aint scary at all Works better as a dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer Too many wisecracks thats for sure The actors arent interesting save Robert Englund as always and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto and there are simply far too many visual effects The finale is OK but doesnt provide as many sparks as I think one might hopebr br In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killers story it provides Englund the opportunity to do more nonmakeup scenes than ever beforebr br There are cameos worth noting a joint cameo by thencouple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shockrocker Alice Cooper and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had becomebr br Film debut of Breckin Meyer who plays Spencerbr br One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing creditsbr br 410,0

The first Cube movie was an art movie It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldnt understand It was on the nonliteral level a man vs cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond mans petty squabbles a world where there were no more struggle but peace I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 and its a movie that was never meant to have any sequelsbr br The second movie Hypercube was a massive disappointment Some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning Still for being fairly entertaining I rated it a 5 out of 10br br The third movie Cube Zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial Bmovie rehash of the first sans the symbolism There is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off The same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a ripoff with absolutely no originality and nothing to saybr br That we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of And in this movie those who get through to the exit like Kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed where the bleep is the sense in that Thats just flippin stupid Im glad I didnt pay to see thisbr br The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10,0
I have just watched this movie on DVD late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience In other words the creators planed to make comedy not drama Howsoever at the end I realized that Mr Tony Giglio was earnest about this movie Its a pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is a fishy tale Poor Ryan Phillippe despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance What to say for Jason Statham lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction For this reasons I vote 310,0
I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully Me thinks he the lady doth protest too much The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself He sites profane literature writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible Anyone can skew data prove anything they like but it doesnt make it true Customs change word definitions change over time look at English German where it is very obviously a common root nothing stays the same its always growing and changing The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one Ive found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped the mean of the entire verse changes Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces without punctuation without paragraphs without numeric verses These writings look like one long word the translators added all of the above For example how would you read this GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here Same string of letters two entirely different meanings This is why many biblical researchers use a Lexicon to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written Its also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesnt exist In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty Talk about ego Putting soapbox away God Bless Maegi,0

A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods This is simply not true Prior to the construction of Interstate 64 which bypasses the Ocean View area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View Once the interstate was completed Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg Meanwhile in the past few years the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a soughtafter location for construction of highend housingbr br It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film Rollercoaster This is also untrue Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to Death of Ocean View Parkbr br As to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for Bgrade movies of the time With the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors I dont believe this film was intended to be another Citizen Kane I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new nonnude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into apparently not A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway lets come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demisebr br For the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film except for Diana Canova fans but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk the first Harborfest and Old Dominion University Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome,0
I was expecting a lot from MrAmitabh Bachans role of SARKAR but am disappointed Being a Ram Gopal Vermas direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan not his son Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father,0
This movie pretty much sucked Im in the Army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible If your in the Military and you see this movie youll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad It was ridiculous They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniforms on not knowing what to do It was a pretty gory movie Id have to say the least There was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump Id recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent gory movie It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military I also would have to say I liked the first one better than this one,0

So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Eberts book I hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one a rare zerostar rating in the book and said at the end of his original review Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Eberts review of Rob Reiners North where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I dont think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well But above all the other things that were awful about this movie I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfusss girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill Haha Not funny Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatras My Way sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss who I admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that Independence Day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history Did Goldblum feel that Independence Day would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if Independence Day were a bomb What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this The opening sequence of Mad Dog Time says that the movie is set on another planet I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid Every copy of Mad Dog Time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won its honor as the worst movie ever,0
What a boring film To sum it all up its was basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughterinlaw Karisma Kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son Can someone say BORING The concept wasnt too bad but it was poorly executed The Canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot However overall the cinematography came up short The story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on There is only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hours of itbr br The best part of the whole movie was the song Ishq Kamina and that was only five minutes long Other than that this movie was a piece of crap,0
rant start I didnt want to believe them at first but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie Gwoemul aka The Host of 2006 which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a Bmovie genre successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets mainly spent on special effects have become more and more fantastic Do South Korean moviemakers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry has built up since the 1999 breakout film ShiriSwiri by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did rant endbr br The only reason I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean East Asianstyled dragon I have seen to date for the final scenes Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 Dragonheart the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons Remember Dungeons Dragons in 2000 Hasnt anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use but how WELL you use it I hope there are more and better Korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this onebr br In short I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem Arirang being played at the very end As a creature feature I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it but Ive seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons,0
As a native Chinese I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a better world I said better world because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years br br I guess most western audience may dont know Qin Shihuangmeans the first emperor the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China The TianxiaChinese word was spoken by the king means the land and the people spoken from his mouth is totally lie From then on one after another all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they saidbr br Another fact is Qin Shihuangs empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by peoplebr br Well I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant,0
This had a great cast with bigname stars like Tyrone Power Henry Fonda Randolph Scott Nancy Kelly Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesserbutknown names with shorter roles It also had Technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939br br Now the bad newsregrettably I cant say much positive for the story It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive lightand Hollywood has done that ever since Why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me This film glamorizes them and made their enemies the railroad people into vicious human beings The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous Well thats the film world for you evil is good good is badbr br Hey Hollywood heres a news flash The James boys were criminals Really look it up,0
I dont normally write reviews but this film was special I couldnt turn it off I dont believe Ive ever seen a worse movie but there I sat watching It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway It was disgusting but I couldnt turn away Where do I start The movie seems to think its a sports thriller but its so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but its not funny not even in a dumbsilly way Its like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family gettogethers Its painful to watch but at least its only for a minute or two Second String went on for over an hour br br Whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again The writing directing acting and everything was just terrible The problem is I cant describe how bad it was you just had to see it And Im sure this will NEVER be shown again so unless you saw it youre out of luck I mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film Ive seen over my lifetime And for every film I see in the future that I cant stand I will think to myself well at least it wasnt bad as the Second String,0
I watched this movie on TV last night hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease I was disappointed and I think the movie was garbage It did not seem real to me Some of the acting was awful in particular that of the doctor She was about the worst Ive seen The whole thing played like a CNN worst case scenario Even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didnt seem sincere I have seen some disaster movies in particular those weather ones which are actually so bad they are amusing This one is almost as bad but it is not even amusing it is tedious and boringDont bother with this one,0
1 I am not weapon expert but even i can see difference between US army riffles in WWI and WWII In movie we can see privates armed with M1 Garand invented in year 1932 not authentic 1903 Springfield aka Silent Death who privates use until WWII Difference M1 can load 15 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate M1 was semi automatic Springfield requires reloading after every shot Little difference 2 German army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 Year too Especially helmets German helmets until end of WWI have significant pike on top we cannot see even one in movie And if we make little additional search in archives how much truthful is this True Story I am surprised how much truthful can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation,0

The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend Her aunt Edna May Olivera person too talented for this film didnt like Wheelera sentiment I can easily relate to The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king At about the same time Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king So when Wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friendswhich greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastimebr br I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywoodthe silent era through the 1940s I have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey I cant help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better For example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brothers film DUCK SOUP yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp At times Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny In fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly His only funny quality was that he looked goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film Additionally Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sang very poorly A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as whos on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing In fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routineso prematurely that you are left frustrated I knew that whos on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twistbr br Once again I have found yet another subpar film by this duo While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERSwhich I actually gave 6s to on IMDb this one was a major endurance test to completesomething that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey Where was all the humor,0
I was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips And talk about hype I even heard an interview with the shows creator on the BBC World Today a show that is broadcast all over the worldbr br Unfortunately this show doesnt even come close to delivering All of the jokes are obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they are not given any new treatment or twist All of the characters are onedimensional The acting is well mediocre Im being nice Its the classic CBC recipe one that always failsbr br If youre Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if youre white youd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both Not that making fun of white people is a problem most of the better comedies are rooted in that Its only a problem when it isnt funny as in this showbr br Canada is bursting with funny people so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis So how come the producers of this show couldnt find any,0
First of all Mexican werewolf in Texas is not a werewolf movie This title is bullcrap The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of Furlough in Texas I suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something And I guess it actually works because thats the reason why I bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid Anyway the movie isnt any good Actually its bloody awful But I didnt expect anything else when I bought it Its a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster If you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie But I must warn you this movie is really baaaaaaadbr br This movie has some of the worst acting I have ever seen The actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous They almost never say a line in a normal way They always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say Its so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody Its like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it The worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo Shes the worst of them all I have never seen an actor as bad as her And Ive seen Pteradactyl Even when her boyfriend dies she cant stop being a bimbo about it I hate herbr br Some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good The ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project But most of the movie is shot in the night when the Chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark The gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent The effects are pretty hilarious really but thats the way I like it The Chupacabra looks pretty messed up and its easy to see that its a guy in suitbr br Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and its very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death I recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer,0
This movie is so Godawful that it was literally a chore to watch I wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room but kept thinking foolishly that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right You lose we win yay This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that Jackie Mason was funny After that beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks And if youre even considering renting this turd or worse yet have I have one thing to ask of you didnt you even look at the cover I mean with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is Oy vey This movie sucked,0
Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a jollies project for Robert Redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshinebr br The story is as light as powdered snow with Redfords smalltown boy David Chappellet what kind of lead name is that who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and teammates Women are a mere sideshow in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pickup scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a freethinking independent woman played by Camilla Sparv The skiing sequences are fine with some good stuntwork involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day Plus Im not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel I couldnt really be that excited for him one way or anotherbr br Of the actors Redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way hes doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic waybr br In truth though theres a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences dont fully compensate and you dont care a fig for any of the leading characters One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it,0
This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972 Regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time periodwith some camerawork and pop art stylings that are pure late 60searly 70sbr br The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art its interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome The film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals,0
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast Icecream I Scream is more like a caricature of sinceritybr br The plot opens with the dream of Ali a traveling icecream salesman in a Western Anatolia town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big icecream companies He dreams of playing in his products TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him As his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason Is it because he is not successful in his job Apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global icecream companies But this is what he says we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling icecream to the people in the town Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep powdered roots of mountain orchids Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzybr br In a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town In search of his stolen bike Ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously Annoyed by the nagging of his wife Ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk One of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison His wife wakes up and prevents him An old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life According to him Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing When he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood Meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much icecream They confess to the doctor that they stole Alis bike Ali forgives them and there comes the happy endbr br Although the plot may look promising in a way its the storytelling which makes this film insincere and cheesy First the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs And the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art Even Alis troubles are not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his words The director markets his film as a righteous fight of Ali against big icecream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies We dont see their pressure enough The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft And when his motorbike is found it solves every problem Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband Not a real criticism of globalismbr br Second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy Maybe Im wrong maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars or to have a political message If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a mans big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman saying fk you then you may find this film funny,0
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so I am happy to see any of their films Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do Stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollies leg cast string and manages to push The Doctor Billy Gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling When the situation calms down Stan gets Ollies clothes as the Doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen Filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isnt great but its a black and white film worth looking at Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians Comedian Okay,0
OK I have to admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well documented failings This however was the worst film I have seen since Demons at the Door Compared to DATD the effects are vastly superior However the plot is weak the acting reminiscent of everyones favourite the porn film and the decisions and actions of the characters consistently verge on the moronic I feel like trying out Uwe Bolls latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over HOTD2 I am not suggesting that he is really the cure more a case of a different disease but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up OK there it is I have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is House of the dead 2,0

There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flicks abundance of clichés throughout and I agree completely both with regard to the characters AND the dialogbr br Id read about Elizabeth Berklys awful performance in the equallyawful Showgirls which Ive never seen and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of Lifetimes worse fare There was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt have been If so it would have placed the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt a hint of depth or charisma not a trace in any one character performer or portrayalbr br The principals handling of Lizs initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable Her husbands initial reaction and advice were likewise Forrest Gump attacking Jennys boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentallychallengedbr br The smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the professionbr br Finally and frankly I rather enjoyed this part the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that youd rather depend upon Barney Fife without Andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community I know that most reallike cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the Law and Order series and the like but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on Lifetimebr br Finally I found a kind of story within a story fascination with Joshs concoction of his being the victim of his teacher This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story This was something of an achievement like going from F to Fminusbr br This whole lame situation should have been resolved in real life in about 15 minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hours blank film in the camera br br But the writers here proved with their ending they could do even worse When the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemptionbr br This ones a 2 presentation the second because it does have some mild fascination,0
Why is it that Canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre other then action I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck I just could not change the channel its sheer stupidity sapped my willpower Its pretty telling that the cast IMDb credits with this monstrosity apparently never worked againbr br Bad acting bad writing bad narration bad music bad hair bad cinematography It just goes on and on The movie really has nothing to recommend it If youre looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out there are a tonne of other films that wont require you to scorch out your retinas afterwardsbr br I hope this film didnt get money from the government for financing otherwise Im never paying taxes again,0
It was 1 am in the morning and I had nothing else to do Dont judge me pleasebr br Were back in time during the Spanish settlements A group have made their way onto an island It doesnt take too long before they encounter a large reptile which gobbles up their horse Soon theyre captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the reptile gods THE CG sucks it reminds me of the CG of early console video games The encounters were lame The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit Otherwise its just a middling effort,0
As the number of Video Nasties Ive yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when I saw it was availablebr br The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut Hes brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER Granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood After stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour Now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever pingpong balls for eyes and thats pretty much it His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and I found myself muting much of those scenesbr br Oh did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity This is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but its not a redeeming factor for gore fans Also Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy closeups of female genitals and sadly male as well So if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got itbr br I cant recommend this trash to anyone Its not even the good bad movie Its just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last If you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true,0
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 I gave it an extra star just because David Keiths gun was cool,0
I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film He failed thank Godbr br The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin wont like her because shes ugly The film is just bad for so many reasons The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit Those two scenes made me cringe Janeanes character is sickeningly arrogant and guessing from her role as standup comedienne and archfeminist is in real life too She claims that the film is antifeminist when in fact its just realistic Men more often than not go for looks over personality Its interesting to note her hypocrisy too Shed been a feminist and comedienne for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film I mean come on She acted in it for Heavens sake What this film was really was antimen if anything It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurmans character Noellebr br There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplins character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure Is that the best the script writers could come up with Blimey theyve never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made Theres also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isnt ugly but is actually beautiful Erm was I watching the same film as they were Shes certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one Although having said that I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well shes lanky and gaunt lookingbr br I guarantee three things about this film if youve never watched itbr br You will know what the ending will bebr br You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing andbr br You will be bored after ten minutesbr br Watch at your own peril,0
The cast of this film contain some of New Zealanders better actors many of who I have seen in fabulous roles this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot Most of the cast appear to be from the great long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street Its as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party the result of too many gins and possibly a bit of salmonella Imagine Under Siege meets The Love Boat staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the ideabr br If you are an actor I recommend you see this film as a study on how to destroy your carer,0
I am amazed with some of the reviews of this film The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoescom This film is awful The plot is extremely lazy It is not scary either People out there who think that because it stars Sarah Michelle Geller it is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it This film is more like Dark Water except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it I was extremely disappointed with this film It didnt scare me nor interest me either Lets face it this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage eg the dead trying to contact the living Dragonfly What Lies Beneath Ghost Story Dark Water Darkness The Changeling etcetc It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans The films that are coming out of Hollywood like this are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer Theyre just being churned out,0

It wasnt until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producerstar of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic You know when youve been painting a wall until youre completely bored Well thats the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when theyre swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner br br The plot centres on Soloman the King of Israel having an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not being happy about it You cant really blame them since theres few things more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks though the Israeli women here all seem to look like Cherie Blair Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in European and American accents br br After much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed And no thats not praise we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who cant read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them This is what I dont get Even though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the Israelis never ever realising theyre charging towards a gaping ravine Isnt this somewhat illogical Its also something of a revealing error since the horses chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures br br Anyway the film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory But who needs Moshe Dayan Arik Sharon or God when youve got an idiotic enemy who cant see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall,0
1983s Frightmare is an odd little film The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic 30s40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the thenexploding 80s slasher genre It isnt totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the lessthanprofessional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance classier than the movie deserves by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala Vincent Price named Conrad Ratzoff At the beginning of the movie we meet the hasbeen horror star as hes shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol Conrad is a bit of a hoitytoity prima donna jerkoff Just when you think he couldnt be any more unlikable the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death Nice huh Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die Still feisty even at Deaths door he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respectsbr br It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrads grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party Not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an 80s horror film Logic has no place here The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrads body seated in a place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning In the meantime Mrs Ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husbands body has called in a psychic friend to try and reach Conrad through a seance You can pretty much figure out the rest from here Since Conrad wasnt a very nice guy in life its not much of a stretch to assume that he wont be any friendlier in death Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he reawakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one This is where the movie falls apart Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying Hello Is anyone there are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out WAY later than any semiintelligent people would have figured out the same thingbut again were in an 80s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrads body back to its crypt where it belongs The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than musicthunder moans and groans howls etc that becomes severely annoying after a whilebr br I cant really recommend Frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the 80s Modern Horror fans will doubtlessly find Frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy If you came of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from Frightmare Fans of Jeffrey ReAnimator Combs may also want to check it out as the future Dr West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film studentsbr br I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label paired with Roy Wards Vault of Horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible Im told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma which seems appropriate If youre a Troma kind of person then Frightmare will be right up your alley,0
I think that you can not imagine how these people really work Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there I actually thought quite the same as you do But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TVshow have to do I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long That really is no easy work And also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act I dont think that the material given to them can really show that as I think this material isnt very good But THEY are truly good So I dont think that you before you havent seen these guys doing there work can judge over them And I shouldnt have judged over them as well before I met them but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it So please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent seen them doing there job,0
As usual I am making a mad dash to see the movies I havent watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has There is no story A group of guys meander around Iraq One day they are here diffusing a bomb Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire No wait here they are back in Bagdad There is no cohesive story at all The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures By that I mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesnt follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs What do you think is going to happen Well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesnt follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways Why yes Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy Why yes There is no story here The script is juvenile and predictable The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look artsy And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture go rent Full Metal Jacket Deerhunter or Platoon Dont waste time or money on this boring movie,0

Having read during many years about how great this film was how it established Ruiz among the french critics specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd when I finally watched it about a year ago I found it pretty disappointing but then I guess my expectations were skyhigh Shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cerebral film made for TV and mercifully only an hour long is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an offscreen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film,0
Did the first travesty actually make money This is another sequel along the lines of ANOTHER STAKEOUT that no one asked for But weve received it anyway The sequel is like its predecessor completely braindead Its also pretty disgusting remember the dinner scene To think I almost felt sorry for Ritter Yasbeck and Warden Did they need the money that much,0

I just saw this film on DVD last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning It seems that I Robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb and given rise to a lot of insults and namecalling toobr br I find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad What this film really is isdepressing Depressing that the US filmgoer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichéd reheats and acclaim them as spectacular new works This film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of Asimov and modernday uberaction to Smiths character a smartmouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from Matrix and a few othersbr br I Robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for todays audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline Smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be Hollywoods latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis The story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but I dont think most people drawn to this film are criticallyminded enough to notice Perhaps a blockbuster by todays standards but very Bmovie compared to true winners,0
This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seenbr br I have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay I found them pretty bad it just wasnt realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual storybr br Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story The archaeologists are looking for the set They do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egyptbr br If youre shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert The beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desertbr br The actionlevel was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax It made the movie look short and thats certainly a pro for this particular movie,0
Theyve shown i twice in a very short time now here in Sweden and I am so very tired of it The bad acting isnt enough The story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists I love the original from 1953 so I recommend you to go and rent that one instead Because this one is such a bore,0
Having seen Carlo Lizzanis documentary on Luchino Visconti I was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by Adam Low But the viewer like me did get dissatisfied I faced a need for critical opinion which I generally dont like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer There are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally But when I read the reviews already written on this title I also felt a bit confused People sometimes dont know what to criticize Therefore to be clear Ill divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about Visconti before his directors career and latter one about Visconti the director br br The aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented His effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents divorce We also get a very accurate idea of where Luchino was brought up as a real count of Milano in riches galore with nannies cooks with access to everything in TRUE ARISTOCRACY For instance his fathers splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that There is also an emphasis on Viscontis crucial visit in Paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people left wingers who later had impact on his style and message in art That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing a contrast at first sight br br However the part about his directors career which started with OSSESSIONE during WWII and ended with INNOCENTE just before the directors death in 1976 is poorly executed His movies are not discussed well Why Because there are very few people who really have something to say Franco Zeffirelli the director remembers the works on LA TERRA TREMA and that is all right There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi But later such movies like IL GATTOPARDO LA CADUTA DEI REI LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig I did not like the interviews of his Moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary There is no mention of significant works of Visconti like CONVERSATION PIECE there are no interviews with eminent cast Burt Lancaster A mention about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made There is one footage interview with Maria Callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit Franco Zeffirelli though I appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious For instance he mentions the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service Therefore I say simplified and unsatisfactory br br What I find a strong point here are footage interviews with Visconti himself As a result we may get his own opinion about his works For instance I very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIGbr br I believe it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI 1999 by Carlo Lizzani than this doc Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole you will get a better idea of the director Visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned peoples emotions and viewpoints into stone 410,0

Never saw the original movie in the seriesI only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie It was however a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark Really this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80s but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70s The Town the Dreaded Sundown,0

The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film It should have read Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your familys church at 8 years old listening to the preacher drone on about Gods will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Legobr br It starts off well intentioned building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Rennys how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast moment It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelisticinduced babble I believe I counted the use of the word pray about 53 times in a five minute span near the end After the 31st I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym prey Sadly this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say prayer preyer to me as it became totally zany Indeed even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom almost to the point of ending up on the floorbr br For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 810 stars I suggest sticking with your theologyreinforcing safety standards like Circle Square The Ten Commandments anything from Narnia Jesus Christ Superstar and the like Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp The God Who Wasnt There What Would Jesus Buy or the soontobe released Religulousbr br Maybe Robert Whitlows book is better,0
I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for 5 on VHS She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch This movie however scared the hell out of me You may be asking yourself how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions Pitch to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas Thats right Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day for if Santa doesnt make it back to his home in space he turns to powder Dont get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy,0
Although there are some snippets in this 4part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these are not very welldeveloped in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugsbr br Although this program as a whole leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserves some praise almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes tovery real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you if asked they think the drug war is designed to solve For example while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80s at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame Inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensued and the subsequent reversal of prohibition is totally ignored by this programbr br This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems but not all users do their drugs in excess just like not all alcohol users are alcoholicsbr br If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science has decided to totally prohibit whose users it has decided to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it None of that is in herebr br On the other hand this is hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda It is mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana LSD heroin cocaine MDMA and Oxycontin But there is a significant element of various peoples points of view with regard to drug laws and most but not all of that is not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana br br The criminal justice system along with its often harsh liferuining penalties is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs a lack of compassion for fellow humans a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentallyapproved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prisonpolicing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity Its morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs yet this program ignores itbr br So in sum the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining But when it comes to presenting a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives its pretty disappointing,0
First I realize that a 1 rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst This movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out its not bad in a selfaware overthetop sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value It simply misses its mark on every count Contains possible spoilers The dialog is completely disingenuous The continuity is so deliberate its painful Daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start The mockshock of whats her name see I dont even remember her characters name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the Baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things Vegetable carts gone flying Cars crashing into each other Motorcycles going down the stairs People nearly being hit but remarkably no one is Oh thats right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didnt notice him there Hmmm br br Its becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money youd think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing Now theres a novel idea br br My suggestion dont see this film Dont rent the DVD Dont watch it on cable There are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied,0
Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public also black in the street and ask him if he is black then walk away The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode More laughter Now if you think the premise is funny and the show contains many such types of situation you will enjoy this show For the rest use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny Another example of the humor in the show a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers I could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all,0

I decided to watch this movie because Id not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie Im sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is a dog and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn both of whom were great actorsbr br The problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer John Manson played by Stewart who marries Jane played by Lombard within an hour of meeting her Whats that cliché Marry in haste repent at leisure br br In short the story is a series of episodes that show the couples worsening financial status their troubles with Johns livein mother their struggles to pay the bills Johns diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son John Jnr unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother the couples angst about their marriage the babys sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot in a fierce storm to bring a special serum to save the child and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firmbr br How many more clichéd situations could the writers include Maybe Mother dying soon after There wasnt much comedy the drama was lacklustre at best the dialog was painful to hear Only the acting of the four main players was adequatebr br This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the moviebr br So it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun American values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative all against the backdrop of the average American family Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard br br And it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939 so it was planned in 1938 soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II Hence this sort of film was a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join England in war As many here would know Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the warbr br However Im glad I saw it as a piece of disguised sociopolitical propaganda But Ill have to see other Lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting rangebr br As another reviewer noted see this one just to say that youve seen all of Stewarts movies otherwise dont bother,0
Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that theres nothing to spoil about that movieEven if B Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost itThis film is just empty nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 minNo sex no bloodits suppose to be about snuffno actors no dialogs just as bad as an 90TV filmIts even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epicsSo Rest in peace Bruno you will stay in our minds forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gems asZombi 3 RobowarRats laltro infernoVirus Cruel jaws and few othersSo except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Francos spirits new film pass on this oneBut if you dont know this nice artisans career track down his old films and have fun,0
Hypothetical situations abound onetime director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate postapocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the streets in the stores and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of a forgotten desert One lone survivor attempting to rekindle his sanity takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert All alone he hopes for more but with nobody around he is left with white underwear and a passion for a local Indian tribe until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence Alan a man of the book is left on Earth after an unknown disaster Thinking he is alone he begins living life his way until Jeri Ryan appears like she would in any dream out of the woods disheveled and unhappy to find the final man alive to be well like Alan Anyway they try to coexist fail get drunk and before creating the ultimate dystopia they run into Redneck Raphael played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr Bonds are torn confusion sets in a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs brainless jock Even with nobody left on the planet it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arisebr br Using a variable film technique Ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled The Quiet Earth which I will be viewing next oddly which he never gives any credit towards With a borrowed story I guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston tries to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film directors techniques to attempt to find his own He opens the film interestingly enough but fails to answer any direct answers Sure the final days have arrived but could there be a concise answer as to how or better yet why these select few survived A spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film The juxtaposition would have been like Shawn of the Dead but instead left us feeling like we were watching a madeforTV program Listening to the audio commentary I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made and his passion nearly sells the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasnt as happy with his overall final product There were mistakes ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out While this does make for decent independent filmmaking it sometimes feels cheap and in Ralstons case it was the latterbr br I must admit David Arnotts portrayal of Alan hooked me He played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well He was funny to both watch and listen to and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer He was a key player in keeping the film together alas I cannot say the same for the rest This was Dan Montgomerys first film and it was obvious I mean really really obvious There were scenes in which I thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance but alas it wasnt the case Then there was Jeri Ryan She pulled into her character near the end of the film which to me was the culmination of the entire piece of art She goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end Confused Again she fell into her character by the end giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured Even as the commentary progressed all that she contributed was a laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment While her beauty may sell tickets one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful This was her first film so can I be too harsh br br Overall this film felt like it was missing something I though the idea was strong the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs maybe because it is consumed by zinc and we as a race will always want what we cannot have Ralston is not a surprising director his techniques are flawed and preused but he does know how to make a lowbudget comedy I think our idea of funny is different so that is why I couldnt find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical His actors provided the level of acting needed for this film which was lower than average His film was loose meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled ie anything with wings survived which overall harmed the intensity of the film This was a comedy but it could have been much darker and much much funnier For those thinking that Roger Avery was a huge element to this film as we learn from their commentary all he was there for was money the was in essence the bank for The Last Man Dont get your hopes up for any classic Avery momentsbr br Dont expect more from Ralston and that is how I will end itbr br Grade out of,0
Like anyone else who bought this I was duped by the 20 pieces of extreme gore and banned in 20 countries or whatever it says in the box I have to admit I am a huge gore fan and I am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it Tom Savini Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business The revolutionized makeup effects in the 80s Today you dont need them as everything is done on computer But computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up But I digressbr br Watching fantastically gory films like Fulcis Gates to Hell or even Savinis crowning achievement Friday the 13th the Final Chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film You cant tell the difference between reality and magicbr br I cant imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film If that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money As many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath You dont see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like afterwordsbr br The gore Well its here but not as much as one would hope or expect A man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts but other then those two scenes and one involving a scalping there is nothing really much else to this film The scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for Maybe its just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but I was expecting a bit more Call me sick or twisted but isnt that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place I honestly found myself bored in a lot of placesbr br Cannibal Ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great film it is much better than this tripe If you go out of your way to buy this for 2000 you will feel cheatedbr br 310,0
As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones I thought this might be interesting Not so as this film is very of its age in the 1960s To me someone born in the 1980s this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but I am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th 60s I expected drugs galore with th Stones I was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film I have not seen any of the directors other films but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing sort of amatuerish which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash badly directed tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value My only good opinion of this is that I didnt waste money on it it came free with a Sunday paper,0
Watch the Original with the same title from 1944 This made for TV movie is just godawful Although it does use as far as I can tell almost the same dialog it just doesnt work Is it the acting the poor directing OK so its made for TV but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original Especially as youll be spoiled to the plot and wont enjoy the original as much as if youve watched it first br br There are a few things that are different from the original its shorter for once but all are for the worse The actors playing the parts here just dont fit the bill You just dont believe them and who could top Edward G Robinsons performance from the original If you want only watch it after youve seen the original and even then youll be very brave if you watch it through Its almost sacrilege,0
This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57 But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way Just a few of the awful moments in the movie A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience When on the runway perfectly straight of course she is instructed to pull on the flaps HUH Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary This is a movie you want to miss take my word for it,0
regardless of what anyone says its a bmovie and the effects are poorly done if youre a vampire fanatic I suppose it would be OK not 10 out of 10 you others here cant sincerely mean that we are to view this as a movie not read it as a book so the effects and characters are important as well as the story The story are good but it doesnt carry the film no wonder it has a low rating over all I write this because I chose to see this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb but got severely disappointed dont get me wrong I thought the blade movies was awesome and loved the underworld movies but this characters arent close the make up on the vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse this sucks I might not have gotten so disappointed if I had not read reviews here that told me how great it was the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this is awesome you dont care about acting or make up this is better as a book 3 out of 10 for an OK story,0
I want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the English subtitle translation which was actually written not spoken in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist was meant to be selfreferential in a tongueincheek manner But if so director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that I have to conclude Carax actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he cant be bothered letting anyone in on the jokebr br Some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style eg David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story eg Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenbergs later less bizarre works In Pola X Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it Well here it is the pacing is erratic and choppy in particular continuity is often dispensed with superfluous characters abound eg the Gypsy mother and child most of the performances are overwrought the lighting is often poor particularly in the oftdiscussed sex scene unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list goes onbr br Not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions I liked the musical score even the cacophonous industrialtechno music being played in the sprawling abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to Andy Warhols Factory of the 60s Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings And even well into middleage Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has it Her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didnt sink into bathosbr br There was an earlier time when I would regard such films as Pola X more charitably Experimentation is admirable even when the experiment doesnt work But Carax tries nothing new here the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movieviewing and literally thousands of films later I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe At this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking With the exception of JeanPierre Jeunet are there any directors in France who know how to make a watchable movie anymore Rating 310,0
Its hard to praise this film much The CGI for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow Also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tediousbr br I was amazed to see Marcus Aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an exEmperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film Like Whoopie Goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinkerbr br The story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious If you MUST watch this film go around to your friends house and get drunk while doing so then itll be enjoyable,0
I remember going to see the movie in the summer of 78 with my parents and being pretty into it at the time Of course I was seven at the timebr br Right before the Jackson movies came out my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgicbr br Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on a budget this is saying something Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of thembr br Because of budget constraints the movie already a compression of The Fellowship of the Rings and part of The Two Towers was pared down even more What you get is sort of like a filmstrip version of the Cliff Notes of the booksbr br Its not all bad though the animation brings a warmth to it that I found lacking in the Jackson movies Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent fundingbr br This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came Several years later a halfhearted halfhour long TV special was aired which was meant to wrap things up All I will say about that is that it was a musical,0
Just finished watching 2FTM The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend something I never do Needless to say I was very disappointed The story has so much potential and its frustrating to see it get screwed up I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey First off I am not a MM hater I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 34 times Yes we all get it that he a goodlooking guy with a nice body but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 34 times in the movie is totally unnecessary I think one time would have been sufficient It wouldnt surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unlessEnough about that lets get into his role I feel his acting was very forced and he didnt seem very comfortable I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner but his lines were corny and cheesy It was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times In short I didnt like his character even though I was supposed to The accent his shirt off corny pick up lines weak sales pitches His character was just too much of a tool as Brandon or Jonathan Pacino and Assante were great but that no surprise Piven is fun to watch as Arieoooops I mean Jerry I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly Its insulting that they could take a great story and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success 1 Cool story that appeals to the male man 2 Hunky Hollywood actor for female women make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights 3 Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 great one liners 3 Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4 Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4 Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5 Plot good writing character development and intelligent casting are unnecessarybr br This will be good enough for most people but not me Anybody who disagrees with me ask your self this Would this movie be much better if A Directed by Sodeberg B DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MMbr br I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing The movie going public gets what the movie going public wants big budget crapola,0

As a longtime fan of all the Star Trek seriesI found this a disappointing episode and I wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring Will Rikers exploits both positive and largely romantic and negative lots of pain and a crewmates deathwas a moneysaving device as were many of their bottle shows episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise Diana Muldaurwho also appeared at least twice on the original series deserved a better final appearance than this for her character Dr Kate Pulaski Loyal viewers in the Star Trek world is there any other kind also were shortchanged This was the last episode of second season thus the season ended not with a bang but with a whimper,0
Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not A college professor David Norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption He pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named Adam As it turns out Adam doesnt have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr Norwell This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around Adams inabilities and seizures Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out Personally I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack Bypass this yawner,0
This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell and did so Really awful jumble of unlikelyunexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line all without character or clear motivationbr br We get cliché snapshots instead of characters One in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss who projects an overdone tough guy persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her Nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase as in the smallest from a complete American Tourister set in a bright sky blue without explanation or apology Otherwise its standard visually one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT,0
Baba Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life This is the movie which caused his downfall It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred Soon after its release he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably Its a very bad movie with horrible acting badquality makeup and pathetic screenplay Throughout the movie Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease Im one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba first day first show in theatre The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission Sorry Ill not recommend this one to anyone,0
First the CGI in this movie was horrible I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel At the end when the owner of the park gets killed its probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have even seen Even Night of the Living Dead had better animationbr br That said the movie had almost no plot Why were they on that island in particular Well it wasnt stated in the movie And why would the people keep coming into the cats area Makes no sensebr br One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting In what could be called a B made for TV movie movie the acting was very good Parry Shen stood out in particularbr br If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday watch this movie It may be good for some memorable quotes,0
What a waste of talent A very poor semicoherent script cripples this film Rather unimaginative direction too Some VERY faint echoes of _Fargo_ here but it just doesnt come off,0
Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a definitive 120page pointbypoint linebyline refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled A CONVENIENT LIE The website address where his debunking report which is titled A SKEPTICS GUIDE TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH can be found at is  A shorter 10page version can be found at  Once you read those demolitions youll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the Y2K scare of 1999 which Gore also endorsed as he did the pseudoscientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW which was based on a book written by alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber As James The Amazing Randi does to psychics and Philip Klass does to UFOs and Gerald Posner does to JFK conspiridiocy theories so does Mario Lewis does to Al Gores movie and the whole global warming scam,0
Sigh Im baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak Tim Burtonish style and the story that goes nowhere And we got the joke about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time alrightbr br But I guess whats really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge As any quick internet search will reveal I mean what is this This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker Give your head a shake as Don Cherry might say,0
This movie came as a huge disappointment The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain but I expected Shamballa to tie up all the loose ends Unfortunately it didnt It added more plot holes than it resolved and confused more than it clarified The animation and voice acting were great but with an idiotic plot dull setting most of the movie doesnt even take place in dull WWII Earth rather than the Alchemy world and disappointing ending Ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy and he ditches Winry it was altogether pretty lackluster Do yourself a favor disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie and read the manga,0
They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion Once theyre grown its easy to spot the writerdirector among the four Hes the quiet contemplative longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood Only theres no writing or directing talent on display here And if you still cant figure out which one he is heres a hint The auteur and his character have the same middle name It took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school What looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal Once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father How about hitting back kid like you do everyone else Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose Howlingly bad dialogue Many scenes badly out of focus Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience Overacting in the extreme And if you dont quite get the selfimportant speeches or the slowmotion scenes just listen to the overbearing music It will clue you in and what youre supposed to feel Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college Yeah thats the ticket Why is it that every twentysomething filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world cant wait to see it onscreen If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants,0
I watched this movie so that you dont have to I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson but what was he thinking He did this for scale br br At least the films title practices truth in advertising since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film adding to the confusion Kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasnt sure if Genevieve Bujolds character really existed This does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the storybr br The making of feature was far more interesting than the movie itself It explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie even as the film is being shotbr br To its credit this movie is visually pleasing and doesnt in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1M Too bad the money wasnt spent on a better project,0
Just saw this movie on opening night I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it I must say I was not impressed Im so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some moneybr br First of all The Messengers is very predictable and just not much of a thriller It might be scary for someone under 13 but it really did nothing for me The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movies resolutionbr br Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the subpar suspense scenesbr br If youve seen previews for this movie then youve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters,0
I went to see this movie actually I went to see Family Portraits which contains Cutting Moments 2 other short films by Douglas Buck at the Mar del Plata festival Argentina I just couldnt watch it I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while By the time it was over my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun BTW of course I was not the only one who left the room It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it I just dont get how you can love that kind of movies The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days I also try to analyze the story my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it and I just dont think it makes any sense I mean that amount of violence and stuff makes no other sense than to try to shock people And thats not a good enough reason I think Theres absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say Well at least x thing about it was good But well I guess I will never understand that kind of films,0
I dont understand the positive comments made about this film It is cheap and nasty on all levels and I cannot understand how it ever got madebr br Cartoon characters abound Sues foulmouthed alcoholic layabout Irish father being a prime example None of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for Sues Asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence As desperately unattractive as they both are Ive no idea why either Rita andor Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob but given that they do why should I be expected to care what happens to them So many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is If that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on filmbr br I didnt like the film at all,0
Steven what have you done you have hit an all new low It is weird since Stevens last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash Shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasnt even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway As for the action well lets just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesnt make scenes sometimes flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time,0
A callgirl witnesses a murder and becomes the killers next target Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here his camera swoops around corners in a museum after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence again in split screen where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals and stages his first finale during a thunderous rainstorm Dressed To Kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial Much of the acting with the exception of young Keith Gordon is mediocre and the second finale is a ripoff of De Palmas own Carrienot to mention Psycho The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock not an homage Stylish in a steely cold way the end results are distinctly halfbaked from,0
I think my summary says it all This MTVish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X or is that Gen Y type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations Example Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his wedding Kennedy is the bride done up in a full bridal gown and long wig The joke is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his bits and pieces Problem is this schtick goes on way too long obviously to fill out time And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one running around constantly asking Do I look fat I recognize the show was not made for me It was made for 12yearold pinheads who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today So let them laugh Thank God the show was shortlived,0
I saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and latenight 80s sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning I must say I didnt expect much and I didnt get much Although Rose McGowan is hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not Oscarworthy to say the least This movie has its ups and downs and does have a nice couple of twists at the end but in all honesty it was awful Not even a typical slasher movie No gore no sex no nudity no real violence Just bad acting Id give it a 3 out of 10,0
This film cant make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or dont ever go in the water again A fisherman Nolan is out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally ACCIDENTALLY mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and I use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself I doubt it was her first When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous selfinflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan Obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychosbr br The film reeks of halfthought out antihuman message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all Its true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whales pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little betterbr br The films final journey in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of Melvilles eerie manwhale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident Its clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss However it never goes there The whalecharacter has no compassion or respect for anyonebr br The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jawslike where the seamonster finally kills everybody and Nolan and nodoubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whalehugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier I love animals and I detest whaling and what is more I love orca whales but if this films goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed Nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maimingbr br The only message one can walk away with is If you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you,0
Why o WHY did I pick this one up Well i needed a nobrainer in the summer heat and the cover looked coolbr br Of course I shouldve known better This is a really really bad movie And it gets embarasing when the makers know its bad and try cover it up by adding some sexybeautiful women and some sexscenes to it Well folks it doesnt cut it does itbr br If you WOULD like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very very good wellplayed and funny go rent Lake Placid that is an order,0

Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade I havent seen it since I just watched the trailer though Does this look like a first grade movie to you I dont think so I was so horrified by this movie I could barely watch it It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup I was freaked out by this film Now today being 20 I probably would not feel that way I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldnt see this movie even though its PG Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids I dont even remember what it was about once was enough,0
A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other a destroyer of a demons seed The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to The End,0
Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem That is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining ScoobyDoo and companybr br Shaggys voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows Theyve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the originalbr br Im not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby showsbr br And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted I like it but its not real ScoobyDoo type animation But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me this might toobr br Its worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly Besides I am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan Evolve or die as the saying goes Well see how it looks after two more episodes by then Ill have formed a much more solid opinion,0
I often wonder how movies like this even get made and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch thembr br With Aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along adding twists and turns when he liked no matter how ludicrous they were The script was non existent with inane dialogs such as Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai wahee fashion hota hai and Yeh Versace hai Madam yeah rightbr br Every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped Acting was awful Constumes lycra for Udita and awful suits for a stocky Emran locales the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a Victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbishbr br For those people who love Hashmi and his movies watch it As for me Ill never get those two and a half hours back The only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent,0
Uwe Boll slips back in his filmmaking skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way Its as if he couldnt be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away Additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life Im guessing that Boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had It really stinks Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything hes ever learned about film gets flushed The last film he made that was this bad was Seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films Ive ever seen This isnt that bad but it is close simply because it should have been better Then again Udo Keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film Id take a pass unless its late at night and youre catching it on cable,0
This film is dreadful It has absolutely zero laughs Hebrew Hammer Adam Goldberg sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa Andy Dick Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise While there are some far and few nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is laboured hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly boring This despite the fact that Goldberg Dick and Greer Hammers clientlove interest all have quite considerable screen presence Despite being played for what might be described as whacky overthetop gags this film is consistently middleclass middleoftheroad muck DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this note the music was good,0
Its amazing that such a clicheridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place The characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired that its impossible to care about any of them especially Brooke Shields The temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible If you like this genre youd be better off renting Singles or Bodies Rest Motion,0
I am a big fan of old horror movies and since I am middle aged old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920s to 1960s period I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being Creepshow 1 which I thought was great I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending All the stories were great though So why did I like them so much The characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDbcom lol When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing its telling you something4 of 10 Also Romeros expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard I dont know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me and thats not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on Its shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it,0
Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made Well they are only partly right For me this IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD I have never seen anything so basely crude and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film A true embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry this isnt even so Bad its good There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis other bad movies like Clambake This one is so rotten to sit through its painful Pure Garbage Native Americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here Actually perhaps ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 Stars seriously Grade F,0

Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film that always sounds like a terrific plan Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like The Flesh and the Fiends and From Beyond the Grave pairing up in a mid70s satanic themed exploitation flick How can this possibly go wrong Well unfortunately it can To my deepest regret Land of the Minotaur can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise In a remote little area in Greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a firebreathing Minotaur statue Cushing who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area Father Roch the priest of a couple of towns before decides to investigate Land of the Minotaur is a boring and extremely slowpaced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details The titular Minotaur for example is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance Instead the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance His portrayal of rude bossy and oldfashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always,0
Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2 I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III WRONG I wish Id stopped at II The storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter Pacinos protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2 Then scenes such as Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shotdaughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isnt ready for an emergency NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again But Ill watch 1 2 many times down the years,0

I had heard and read so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series like Entourage Sopranos or Mad Men but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One didnt make it past the first six episodes br br The writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing The dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laughbr br The characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brotherinlaw who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator and the removal of the Hodes daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewers loyaltybr br Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldnt get past many of the technical flaws in the story linebr br Add to that I heard that Season Two wasnt as good so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play outbr br If youre a fan of good casting and writing I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like unless of course youre stoned and then all bets are off,0
Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice gruesome makeup effects Daniella is a beautiful twentysomething girl carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing shes the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf She kills her brotherinlaw during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital She escapes again however and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives doctors and relatives Its all pretty to look at and listen too really great soundtrack but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast Luckily enough leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire The film is too long too weird and too forgettable The biggest surprise comes at the end when suddenly and out of the blue director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts Yeah right,0

Mexican Werewolf in Texas is set in the small border town of Furlough where Anna Erika Fay lives her best friend is Rosie Martine Hughes she has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel Gabriel Gutierrez who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town killing livestock several residents including some of their friends Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacabra an evil creature from myth legend Erm Im struggling now because not that much else actually happensbr br Written directed by Scott Maginnis I wont beat about the bush here simply say that Mexican Werewolf in Texas is awful period The script only ever mentions the word Werewolf once the rest of the time its referred to a Chupacabra in fact I suspect this wasnt really conceived as a Werewolf flick at all The Werewolf creature looks mostly hairless more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions there is no transformation scene at the end when it is killed it doesnt change back into anyone either To be honest apart from the title theres nothing here to indicate a Werewolf film at all even then the title is just a ripoff of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London 1981 This is the type of home made crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead 1978 The Evil Dead 1981 Halloween 1978 or Friday the 13th 1980 which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe The Blair Witch Project 1999 but thats it in recent years crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic The characters are awful things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks virtually sent me to sleep as a whole this film is just crap Im sorry but I dont know how else to describe itbr br Director Maginnis does nothing to make this watchable theres the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache quick blink youll miss something editing which just annoys irritates in equal measure Its not scary theres no nudity theres no tension or atmosphere the special effects are awful The monster really does look poor its no wonder Maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it Theres virtually no colour to the picture either its either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well The gore consists of some fake guts blink youll miss them a few bloody wounds a severed arm big dealbr br With a supposed budget of about 300000 I admit the budget was low but I simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far The whole thing has the look of a home movie it has no style is throughly bland dull to look at The acting sucks too although you probably already knew thatbr br Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably con a few people into rentingbuyingwatching it because they might mistakenly think its a sequel to John Landis classic which it most certainly isnt it isnt even a proper Werewolf flick either Dont be fooled this is awful Im fed up of having to waste timemoney on home made amateur crap like this,0
I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one but when i started with it i found it really awful They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95 of the movie is shot in India you can see Indian made cars you can see lars drinking bislerian Indian water brand Hindi written on the road you can also see temples in Afghanistan hahah its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in Afghanistan I think one should not waste hisher time watching this movie pure time waste i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but dont watch this waste of time,0
Truly appalling waste of space Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end And i can count the films I have switched off before the end on one handbr br The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring I wouldnt be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983 For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone I mean seriously The police would be beating his door down in minutes The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters Oh and what characters they are The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed After 60 or so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character He is neither sympathetic nor hateful Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery Is he happy Is he sad Angry No idea Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh And the native American theme is just awful and pointlessbr br The good guys are at best unlikeable A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic exwife stereotype Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you arent going to shoot me that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoyingbr br The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivatedbr br Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourkes Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves Realistic female characters FTW br br In summary a complete mess of a film Hopeless characterisations and performances A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction And ultimately extremely dull Its not even comedy bad either Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film,0

One could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case The story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a madscientist flick from the early 50s There are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets But alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematicbr br There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms But its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one It is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result Hollow Man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoeverbr br However the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing When making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them Therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down When the whole world blows up the good guys go Oh darn and Oh my God Hollow Man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them Im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears I think we can thank Verhoeven for that,0
All I ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better All the while watching I was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future and there wasnt Ill admit to not finishing the film I had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man Adam that it was ok to be a whore and get and I quote More tail than any man in the past time I know not finishing it is a bad review on myself but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested and they failed This film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance Instead it exemplifies what America ran by lesbian natzis would be likeand Im not against lesbians Thank you Mr Director Someone please give me a redeeming quality wait I have it Theres no sequel,0
I do regret that I have bought this series I expected more action more objective picture and more consistency This is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself I find the actors work quite weak as well ODonnell might seem charming as Robin with Batman but in this picture he lacks any charm Probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up It comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands,0
This film was very well advertised I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it Then I went and saw it I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie I always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny Now it wasnt the worst movie Ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO If you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans Id say pass Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead,0

I took my 14 year old to see this movie We left after 15 or 20 minutes It was absolutely awful This movie should be rated R at the least I am not that strict with movies but this was just too much It was a waste of money I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but this was WAY beyond crude I was sitting there watching and reading a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was I could not believe that it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and see this content I dont understand how the rating system works,0
Its not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS its not available on DVD but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collectionbr br I cant understand how the talented Mr Rickman gets into these mediocre films Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful actors an interesting plot and intriguing twists but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the characters actions Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses Why did he mistrust the detective he replaced There were times when I honestly couldnt tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof Why else would he toss in a toplessalienlesbian porno scene in the first two minutes that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actors Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson to use such awful New Orleans accents As an Alan Freak I confess that I still thought Mr Rickman was sexy in a rumpled weary takehimhomeandtuckhimin sort of waybr br Judas Kiss isnt a great movie but it does have some intriguing moments but I dont recommend it unless youre trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman,0
STMD is not a terrible movie but it IS quite forgettable The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eyestrain Special effects are imaginative but obvious The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesnt gel What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongueincheek humorbr br I cant really recommend that you use your time watching this movie I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film,0

Steven Seagals films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since The Patriot The plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who The film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward Even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow Most of the blame must lie at the directors feet for not even understanding the basics of film making but Seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame Oh and I havent even mentioned how awful the acting is even by Seagal standards Even as straight to video fodder this is not worth a view even for Seagal fans Give it a wide berth,0

I really cant think of anything good to say about this filmnot a single thing The script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference Youd think they would at least get a technical advisor The performances were bad by most of the cast although I dont really blame them the material really stinks The editing was equally bad Ill just stop now its all bad 210,0

Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must detest this almighty slap in their faces A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera By the time he returns still no senior cops SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie this is New York isnt it it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence only after shed stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scenebr br I want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images The horror continues not in the film itself pretty ordinary Im afraid but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners entrusts the work to an untrained cop a rookie cop who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making DNA profiling well nigh impossible Now that was a bright idea eh I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believablebr br I have given this film 410 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolies lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended,0
Let me first off say that I am a believer of ghosts and I do indeed know they exist I have had enough experiences with them to know they are therebr br What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all of this People forget there is more than one Bible thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible Not everyone believes in God and not everyone believes in stereotypical religion br br Religion does not make everything fact one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is breaking the very rules written withinyou are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time slavery is OK and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances None of this Oh that was the Old testament and now we have the New Testament If the Bible is the word of God and cannot be changedthere should be no changes or versions Religion is full of misinterpretations mixed facts and people who so blindly follow it that there Is no other way The excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their Pastor or teacher br br But anyhow onto the review I am a decent fan of Ghost Hunters and when I heard this show was coming soon I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential As much as I like watching Ghost Hunters I do not like some of their members and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted yet cannot explain anything that is going on Just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up does not mean the camera filming the show did not I am glad they are skeptical but its like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not If Ghosts were that easy to capture it would be known as a fact not a belief Its more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well as if there is something there what makes you think its going to perform for you This show is kind of silly Its usually boring and there is lots of talk lots of psychics yet hardly anything happens The main guys filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to or is basically not neededbr br Also the reliance on psychics is too abundant as I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in but most are sometimes hard to believebr br I really wanted to like this show but of the few I have seen I have yet to be terribly impressed,0

This was by far the worst movie Ive ever seen And thats compared to Alexander Fortress 2 and The new worldbr br I should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience For the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be out of screen I didnt think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age i was wrong While typing this message Ive thought of a good reason to buy this movie A joke present at Xmas Im blaming the Mrs for this one as she picked it thanks babebr br Be warnedA true shocker all round,0
This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen Not only that it is a comedy which isnt funny but its also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effectsbr br The two heroes with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot that they touched each others genitals all the time But the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by referring to German history and to show sensitive aspects of the heroes which finds its climax in showing how Erkan and Stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle But I hadnt expect anything better by director Michael Bully Herbig who also made two not funny TVshows a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny SFcomedy movie But Erkan and Stefan had been just a little better in some of their standup programs For me the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel who is very beautiful to me,0
I sat through this on TV hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the timebut dear Gussie whoever thought this script was worth producing The basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face Looks like a bad B movie from the 40s,0
A good ol boy film is almost required to have moonshine car chases a storyline that has a vague resemblance to plot and at least one very pretty country gal barefoot with short shorts and a low top The pretty gal is here dressed in designer jeans but the redneck prerequisites stop there Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff he comes up way short Big John is big but he isnt convincing with the bad part of his moniker Bugeyed Jack Elam is a hoot as always and Bo Hopkins has been playing this same part for decades Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role but there is no STORY It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment Perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is Charlie Daniels singing the theme You know the one it was made famous by Jimmy Dean,0

Minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera Maximum stretched scenes maximum headache inducing jerky zooms maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing Up until the time flashes on the screen of 1201pm you can fast forward and miss nothing since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing To be fair the movie does have some string music that was interesting so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this Unfortunately that was not to be and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief Forget about Trigger Man I know I am trying to MERK,0
it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing The first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go You shouldnt really decide to watch this based on my review or not I saw so little of it I shouldnt even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see itbr br Couldnt they have just made Earnest does Dallas,0
This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seenbr br Casting Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself Supporting cast not too memorablebr br Story The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting The story is weak not enough happens to make a movie about There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here br br The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive br br NOT destined to be a great one to remember,0
Only light spoilers in herebr br Stealing Sinatra is a halfslapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers dimwit victims and a few other sidestories thrown in to eat up some timebr br You will see some poor performances all around in this movie The drama is forced and the humor makes no sense Whether youre watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who wont shut up or a victims father responding to the criminals death threat with Care for some tea none of it is believable This quite comfortably fits into the wannabe movie categorybr br You will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie Its quite unprofessional and adds nothing Its really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat wittybr br However if youre able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertained by the adequate storylinebr br I voted 410,0
Yes this is one of THOSE movies so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing I have watched comedies good comedies and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie The other comments give the idea well enough The characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pausesbr br But the rat yes the big rat Why we didnt get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me Often the big one isnt shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money I surmise however that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with thirdworld dentistrybr br The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene After figuring out that the rats couldnt stand loud noise migraines from the bad acting the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy If youve ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser this film is for you Really you need to rent it and see for yourselfbr br But not for more than 99 OK,0

SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO Im leaning toward rip off After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the Southbr br A group of college girls head to Ft Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road Note to Yankees stay on the highway when you go to Florida Sue Ellen Lisa Stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff Tony March strangle his mistress Merry Rozelle to death Note to Yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the South not because you might witness a murder but you may run across a marijuana plantation This is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being goodbr br While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as Ive seen since Walton Goggins Deputy Steve Naish in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSESbr br A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with herbr br And in the strangest scene Sheriff Dean makes like hes about to rape Patty Carol Cadby and tells her to take off her clothes Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what hes about to do The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ I feel sorry for this preachers flock Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven,0
Although this film has had a lot of praise I personally found it boring There are some nice Brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long The central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first As the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep ones eyes open for,0
No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for The House Next Door from her 1970s novel of the same title or someone else did it This Lifetimelike movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough Having read the book a long time ago we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials which of course one cant find in this version we watchedbr br The films star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body Ms Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy the character at the center of the mystery This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved betterbr br The film has a feeling of a cross between Desperate Houswives with The Stepford Wives and other better known features combined with a mild dose of creepiness The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting,0

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ If IMDb would allow oneword reviews thats what mine would be This film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film The singing the story everything is dull and washed outjust like this public domain print Like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories such as the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND this movie has limited appeal and just doesnt age well Now that I think about it I seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable So my advice is DONT watch this film If you MUST watch an Abbott and Costello film almost any other one of their films except for AC GO TO MARS would be an improvement,0
Once in a while a movie will sweep along that stuns you draws you in awes you and in the end leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form This is not it This is an action movie that lacks convincing action It stinks Rent something else,0
Im stunned that the reviewers IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did Its an innocuous sweet uncomplicated cliché of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels I like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and I were watching thisand before we saw the ratingwe said There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because theres nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences Its possible to make a good film like that and Away from Her is an example but this was amateur hour There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one Truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films Watch The Family Stone Its miles ahead of this schlock,0
I went to see this one with much expectation Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest Even a child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors Todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events Thats precisely what happened with movies like ET and Star Wars a decade ago How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers Seriously dont waste your time money on this one,0

The screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible This film is confusing because the audience doesnt know what the story is I had no problem with the lowproduction values and the acting wasnt great but this is telly so it was fine I dont mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take But having such a nonsensical screenplay is completely unnecessary Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash Avoid this at all costsbr br The prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voiceover to fill in all the details that had been left out The prologue was rushed it wasnt clear what was happening ie The Russian Revolution was reduced to Some riots are happening in Petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them I know the basic history of the Revolution so I could fill in the details those pesky Communists The prologue is best ignoredbr br This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is It sets up this premise in the asylum It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film No Gone The film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence It sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong itll believe anything she says Okay a soppy romance No because it makes no sense The love interest seems like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures This also doesnt work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end They never got married and she returned to America The love story collapses Despite there being plenty of love scenes I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love I find romcom romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that theyve even spent any time with each otherbr br It could have been a thrillertype thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity No the court case is summed up rather than dealt with The bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better filmbr br The funniest thing to consider is what really happened Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together Throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour None of this in the film either Theres a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a One Flew Over the Cuckoos NextTwelve Monkeystype informant Thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story,0
Wow whats this on the video rental stores shelf in front of me Nothing other than a questionable sequel to 8MM It wasnt a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this moviebr br Basically from the plot outline verbatim an American diplomat David Huxley and his fiancée Tish Harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute Risa The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city The mystery is solved when in the end Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter endbr br I didnt like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene Otherwise its a totally different movie It made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didnt believe the words coming out of Davids mouth the whole time But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in troublebr br There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocativebr br David was no heroic person throughout the film You could guess he was the main problem long before the end The actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect There were plot holes How did David and Richard finally impress Tishs father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute There were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS too because it wasnt even about a last breath Nobody really dies But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowherebut that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 34 long moviebr br Go rent and maybe buy the original Its one of Joel Schumachers better and more original films It has everything better about it from this film I wouldnt recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges,0
Ok honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great Its really not There were two good things that came out of this movie 1 Jacks performance he was very good I can tip my hat for him 2 Dannys performance he was good No other then that it got pretty stupid And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy She was so bad She looked the same every time she got scared The problem with this movie was the ending I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently And the over all movie was just stupid The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off 310,0

I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday First of all I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida and here I wasnt disappointed She looked gorgeous Second of all through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Brocas films On this account however I was sadly disappointed I found the jokes predictable apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war and the characters completely onedimensional Also the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion with no sense of drama at all I kept watching until the end but I got bored very quickly and just sat there waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida,0
This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making The lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all We have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways ruined the night OK so pros and cons Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii looks good on bluray Cons worst acting ever you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday Predictable poor plot Zero character development Forced jokes which fall flat Many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma May all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap,0

The problem is the role of the characters in the film Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film two people who are kidnapped treated like animals and yet given such a shallow stereotypical role within the film The kidnapper british anthropologist ends up being the hero of the film because he manages to relate to the pygmies No notion of how the two hostages feel of their point of view of their ordeal I find it is a shallow film with a one sided fundamentally racist view it never manages to move away from the white mans view,0
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toiletpaper No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie For example the names of some Serbian terrorists that I remember are Caradan Maldic Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse What kind of names are that Certainly not Serbian By the way Caradan Maldic What a name I laughed for days thinking about it Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic Secondly there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians A journalist like the main character ought to have known that Thirdly the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbocroatian All this aside this movie is solidly acted but the story is paperthin and full of holes At times it makes no sense whatsoever,0
Criticism does mention spoilersbr br I rarely make user comments but this is one movie I have no problem slandering This movie stinks and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were despite what its ad claims This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller The pace of this movie was extremely slow I actually left for about 10 minutes halfway through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolies character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse hands The movie is not at all scary but tries to compensate this with a lovesubplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolies character and Denzel Washingtons Of course what you get is something comparable to that of the mentorstudent relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling however even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two With such a crappy movie I was halfexpecting a plottwist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen Esoterically speaking I even think the murderers intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial chess game and gets with his pet project Angelinabr br If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts like I am you will not appreciate this film If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catchup on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne the latenight knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serialkiller to prime investigator relationship the horrible woman trying to get by in an allmale dominated workforce aka SOTL see this moviebut even then its too slowpaced and youd be bored,0
Possible Spoilers Perhaps I must say that Cinderella II Dreams Come True is one of the worst movies ever made First of all the movie was made during the height of Disneys sequel rampage It was created around the same time as The Little Mermaid II The Jungle Book II and Peter Pan II all of which were disservices to their original film classics Disney also made The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and Atlantis II but Im going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films and I absolutely adore the original Disney Cinderella The sequel to Cinderella however was a waste of time The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching In the original Cinderella was kind and loving The new Cinderella had very outofcharacter moments with currentera phrasing like Im going to do this banquet my way Let me also tell you that new Cinderella as I have affectionately named her says Ewww That is the antiCinderella I try to find the best in people but in the sequel Anastasia one of the stepsisters is good What the heck Why They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia My question to the world did the people at Disney watch the original Cinderella when making this sequel Well it surely doesnt seem so If I remember correctly Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine I am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie In the first one Anastasia was evil In the second one she is good One just cant leave a story like this I hope Disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming Walt Disneys name Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse,0
Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer Vargas It looks very much like a TV movie not really exciting The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it No real surprises here though it is nice to see Vargas Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowells part is very small and doesnt add much to the movie Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts The chase scenes are standard fare,0
Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome Otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR her downward phase and RICHARD BURTON his miscasting phase Tennessee Williams wrote The Milk Train Doesnt Stop Here Anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his playbut apparently he was the only one Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the moneybr br Whatever it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad babytalk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appearsbr br Its so campy that among Taylor fans its probably considered a must see kind of thing But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand youre way ahead of me Sadly this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress even after winning two Oscars For Burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB Judge for yourself if you dare,0

I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor Like many others on here I dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it cant be a drama there was no suspense so it cant be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project People who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasnt there Like the Blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying This movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie Finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself It didnt,0

I suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be cool but looking back now 45 years its charm was just as silly as its entertainment value Granted the special effects do well on TV with the Series that started in 1964 but for the BIG screen I once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting I must agree about the Octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the Seaview Obviously not well stagedor trained Overall its pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and I still do recommend it for fun laughs sake This was probably one of Irwin Allens Biggest films and I think he thought a lot of it Barabara Eden went on to play Genie on TV Micheal Ansara was her Husband Now that is a cool part about this film I always enjoyed seeing real life Husband and Wife teams star in the same movie Neat,0

This movie was way overhyped A lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the 2 dont mix very well in this movie even with special effects You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying its the greatest movie ever done Its just crap on a stick It also didnt help that the story line was sooo crappy I dont understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and I also dont understand how actorsactresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this Its almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine printIt will all be done on a computer This was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary Im very upset with myself for paying money to see this Whatever you do dont waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow,0

I dunno sometimesyou try and try and try to be charitable towards all the B thru Z grade movies out there but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved Bat People which I saw under the title It Lives By Night is just such a movie You cant watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on Night Gallery and not one of the better ones either br br The movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a WereBat who drinks human blood Actually youd think if he was turning into a real bat hed be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket but because this is a cheap lurid horror movie bloods the word In spite of the fact that he has grandmal seizures at the drop of a hat and blackout episodes almost every night his friend and fellow physician Dr Mustache AspenExtreme insists that hes just having an allergic reaction to the rabies shots Meanwhile the worlds most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls and one wino Also meanwhile the doctors wife decides that denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction br br Its not so much that the acting is bad you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script even the guy who plays the sheriff Okay it IS pretty bad but its bad in a clichéd wooden professional way Its just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involvedbr br I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky unsettling little cult favorite BUTbr br 1The director needed to beat Michael Pataki an experienced character actor with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT and not just channel Dennis Weaver br br 2He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole Bat Bites Human Who Then Turns Into A Bat scenario br br 3 He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episodes instead of resorting to Man Has A Seizure page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms br br 4 He needed to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant br br I would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of Mike and the Bots Its bad but it isnt bad in a silly humorous or interesting way Still better than Battlefield Earth or Waterworld though,0
Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie Well all I can say is I totally regretted it These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant unimaginative and kitch to the extreme not that this is bad on its ownsketches that are supposed to make people laugh but fail to do so The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his movie by starring in itI cant think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack havent disappointed me ever since I would recommend you to avoid this film unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled,0

Why do movie makers always go against the authors work I mean yes things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest but look at Anne of Green Gables They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful I cant believe that they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a dreadful mess Look at all they missed out on by doing that Paul Irving little Elizabeth the widows Windy Poplars and Annes college years for heavens sake Wouldnt it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did This movie was good if you leave the novels out of it But LM Montgomerys beautiful work is something that should not be denied This movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough Anne of Green Gables to life,0
I cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless On the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter Bs amazingly awful book Killing of the Unicorn,0
This film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that its hard to imagine that well see a worse movie this year or in the following years Loves Brother set in Australia among Italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clichés about Italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film The message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films like Suburbia or Lost in Translation but here his pseudoItalian accent is hard to bear See this film at your own risk Trash as trash can,0
I dont leave IMDb comments about films but this this film was bad very bad I fast forwarded through most of it stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene only to continue with the fast forwards Formula plot once the obvious murderers were discounted there was only the one left And that was in the first five minutes Scene by scene it felt as though Id already read the script before because there were no surprises no mystery The Tori character bad bad acting A true waste of time on DVD and a definite lets go to bed early option if its the only thing on television If you watch this film you will find yourself realising youll never be able to get back the time youve just wasted,0

This movie is a real low budget production yet I will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered I give this movie a low rating for the story alone but I met the director the night I saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie He asked me how I enjoyed it and I told him that it was not easy to like My main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters I was never convinced that they were close I also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the filmbr br He told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script That they were added because he felt like I did that the two main characters did not appear close He went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money I agree that they did not do much for the filmbr br Another fact about the movie that I was not aware of is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience This is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer The story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audiences reaction to his own tragedy And the story is tragic However it did not work for me as I never cared for any of the characters least of all the lead What was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means regardless who gets hurt When Ms Youngs character decides to give up he evil ways it appears that she does so because she is ineffective not because she knows she is doing wrong If the movie has a message then I suspect that only the writer is aware of it,0
Turn your backs away or youre gonna get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIENDS BACK Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment youre watching this Its safe to say that the entire movie falls apart with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max We get a name like Johnny every so often and this Johnny has nowhere to go There isnt a specific reason to why our dead corpse crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night so that renders the movie totally useless Without a feeling of sorrow his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that hes dead Johnny takes a bite out of Eddies arm afterwards The viewer is asked a tough question Why does the movie have to be this cornball There is an answer Any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental Living is a coincidence Dead has nothing in common with the movie Show this one to your girlfriend and shell skip the senior prom turning your life into a deserted ruin Blah,0

Im a Christian I have always been skeptical about movies made by Christians however As a rule they are knownothings when it comes to movie production I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen However they did a hideous job of it The acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion one COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to get across Not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong However in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into In short the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen and I would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind,0

A major disappointment This was one of the best UK crime drama detective shows from the 90s which developed the fascinating title character played by Scotlands Robbie Coltrane However this oneoff has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus Coltrane isnt really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems uninvolved almost bored The exsoldiers story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on Coltranes family life seems lightweight Perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one twohour show they would have written this with much more depth As is skip this and watch the old Cracker from the 90s which is far far superior,0
I saw this movie only because Sophie Marceau However her acting abilities its no enough to salve this movie Almost all cast dont play their character well exception for Sophie and Frederic The plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places I saw several good french movies but this one i dont like,0
OK hows this for original this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house What happens that night will surprise only those who havent seen a movie or television show before After a string of murders in which the victims look like theyre bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks There are also a few secondtier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now As a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of Matlock I will give credit where its due the closing scene is clever and amusing if youre still awake,0
This could have been great The voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a T One small problem though the look of the characters mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest stars voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voiceover for this show and it looked too odd to be funnybr br There is a few other problems one being the family plot The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into Here we get too much annoying diversions like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more Married with Childrenbr br If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is its repetitiveness Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of onedimensional Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the showbr br So what more can I say There isnt exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades,0
The film Chaos takes its name from Gleicks 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory What does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie Chaos Nothing The film makers seem to have skimmed the book obviously without understanding a thing about it looking for a theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film In this respect the movie Choas resembles the Canadian effort Cube in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed in Cube a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes the same approach is taken in Chaos disconnected extracts from Gleicks books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever This of course is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience and any literate viewer of Chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered How could a film so bad be made Rewritten as a novel the story in Chaos would probably not even make it past a literary agents secretarys desk How could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film Regarding whats in the movie every performance is phoned in Save for technical glitches it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene The story is uniformly senseless the last time I saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eightyearold Among other massive shortcomings are the following The bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow He has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints Police officers do not carry or use radios Dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy Let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film If there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead,0
I rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh We actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes Unfortunately I dont remember the first half of the movie because all I did was stare at the giant metal braces Jane wore and I didnt hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp The other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense This movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a popstar and you like high waisted jeans ankle socks and knee length skirts then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you,0
The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent No you shouldnt There are spoilers at the end of this review but how I can spoil this rotten movie I have no idea Even if you are a die hard AlienPred fan like I am wait for the DVD It isnt worth a 399 rental either but youll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theaterbr br In the theater I watched AVPr there were exactly two laughs both by a girl sitting next to me Other than that there was total silence throughout No ooohs or that was bad ass nothing Imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic Now you know what youll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of AVPrbr br What was the budget on this movie Like War of the Worlds MI 3 and other fx driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the CGI people can come up with than developing characters or a plot Spielberg has tried and failed at this several times usually with Tom Cruise Sure the movies make money but should they War of the Worlds and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent script Tom Cruise et al and SS himself but were still awful Im sure AVP wasted 90 of their budget on CG and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at randombr br There is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised Who cares who gets killed We didnt know any of them we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit we all know the blood is acid In Alien Aliens 3 Resurrection and even AVP the directors make use of the fact that the Aliens can think can hide and can lay traps This director decided that the Ridley Scott James Cameron and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed In this installment you will never care who lives or dies not a kid a parent a pregnant woman The characters serve only one purpose in this movie to die The opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke The character development scenes mix clichés bad humor and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really dont care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways But they dont The director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films the human protagonists and stealing the rest from other recent scifi filmsbr br There is not one original use of the either the Alien or Pred characters The Pred actually has little trouble killing Aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that Pred revered the Aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as Rite of Passage The AlienPred is never really developed as a fearsome creature Its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was Hellboy where Samiels dismembered tongue injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victims throatbr br Simply put we arent given reason to care about anything in this movie There is violence but it doesnt shock or surprise and is nothing that hasnt been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks The CG is OK and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die The little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we arent made to care whether or not kids women or anyone else lives or dies We just want the movie to end Eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 has a nuke aim Gunnisons way to wipe out the infection And not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it In a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for lastbr br Sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating bad script no plot unoriginal action scenes uninspired direction abysmal acting decent fx that were wasted because of the many flawsbr br I dont mind going to an indie film and being disappointed The actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget For a movie with this type of budget and hype I feel cheated along with disappointed This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits Sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 didnt even look that good,0
The movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream There is not enough realism to hold the viewers interest The Vermont Farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way farms were set up and farm families lived which would have been interesting and entertaining There was little if no research into the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period The costumes of the Canadians looked like something from the French Revolution totally unbelievable The fiddle playing was good and of the time period but Chriss motions while supposedly playing were unbelievable The owls appearance was a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air was too much I couldnt understand how a live trout got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the trout a good food source,0
Its 2005 my friendsa time of amazing special effects and an age of technology So why cant we see a movie thats a little more thought out than this cheesy lowbudget film Ive seen a lot of lowbudget movies that rock my socks off but this oneits almost as if its trying to be horrible Justdontwatch it I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good I feel like a small child produced this entire movie Theres not even an original plot line Vampire Assassins in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself Can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and I just didnt know it It makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment,0
Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981 Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles as Holmess wife and underage girlfriend respectively The rest of the cast has such small roles that its impossible to get any dimensions from them The film also stars Carrie Fisher Ted Levine Franky G MC Gainey Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton,0

Like the other comments says this might be surprise to those who havent seen the work of Jeunet Caro or Emir Kusturica But have you already seen Delicatessen there is nothing new it this film I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest I dont think its a worse film than Delicatessen but its a bore to see it now like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again There is really no point to the film nothing that really matter or stays with you There may be a distant similarity to the films of Kusturica but hes really in a different league so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on Tuvalu,0
To put it simply The Fan was a disappointment It felt like as if I was watching Taxi Driver except Taxi Driver was much better than this It seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for Robert Deniros character 100 percent This approach didnt work,0

The storyplot was okay by itself but the film felt very bubbly and fake It also had the worst ending They were probably going for a surprise ending but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was All other teen movies are better than this one,0
The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was very poorly done The mastering engineer must have been either drunk asleep or not even in the room while it was being done It looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio synchronization disappears The dialog is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio If youre thinking about purchasing this DVD please save your money I remember seeing this film at the theater back in 1973 Also the VHS copy of this film under the title of When Taekwondo Strikes looks better than the DVD but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing Where is the original camera negative,0

Wow im a huge Henry VIIITudor era fan and well this was interesting The only one I watched was the Catherine of Aragon one And wowjust wow Ive seen bad acting before but this reached new heights When the actress who played Catherine was umm crying she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times many many times funny funny stuff The only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn i might be prejudiced though i do have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn she was a really facinating woman read up on her its worth it Also i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the characters werent very acurately displayed they were all very stereotypical Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock,0
It is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible moviebr br Imagine King Kong being recast as an organ grinders monkey and Fay Wrays part being played by a young boy How about Elton John as RamboThis movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the Hunterbr br By using the title Watchers and Dean Koontzs name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the bookbr br Read the book I have never talked to anyone who didnt like it Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi,0
Must have to agree with the other reviewer This has got to be the WORST movie let alone western I have ever seen Terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s and oh did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene And the ending The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the moviecompletely awful And yes it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable lets remember when shots when a main character dies Luckily I saw this on free TV Dont waste your time,0
After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth I finally watched the movie what a waste of time Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore,0
I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago and I actually enjoyed it then I bought the DVD recently and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it The acting was awful and as usual we have the stereotypical clansmen in their fake costumes The acting was awful at best Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson but Ive no idea what Jessica Lange was thinkingbr br The plot line was good but the execution was just poor Im tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films Braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace But seriously people didnt speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans and to be honest I can see why theyd like it I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts However if you are thinking of buying the DVD Id say spend your money on something else like a better film,0
This movie is pathetic in every way possible Bad acting horrible script was there one terrible editing lousy cinematography cheap humor Just plain horriblebr br I had seen The Wishmaster a couple weeks before this movie and I thought it was a deadringer for worst movie of the year Then I saw The Pest and suddenly The Wishmaster didnt seem so bad at allbr br Bad Bad Bad Excruciatingly bad,0
Or better yet watch Fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick Rolling Kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it 25 out of 4 stars which usually means its fairly watchable but I pretty much fastforwarded through it Usually road trip movies have great music but I cant even recall whether there was music The only high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhikerguru Otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way The four main characters are unknown actors and I dont remember seeing any of them in another movie Oh yeah I see that Thos Hayden Church was in it but hes in everything good bad or indifferent This movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when youre not,0
This quasi Jhorror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends She finds that one the daughter of the village priestess drowned several years earlier She and Fumiko another childhood friend then learn that Sayoris mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic Already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie Unlike stellar Jhorror films the suspense doesnt really build the result doesnt seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurdbr br This movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long You end up eating it because you need it with the meal because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey gooey tastelessness of it all 310 ,0

When I first saw it 9 years ago when I was 9 I thought it stunk Im 18 now and I still think it stinks I mean geez no Special effects or anything it was boring and kinda anticlimatic My cousin watched once and George Takai Sulu kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better but they kept cutting to the budget It would have been a great episode but it was a terrible movie,0
Saw a screener of this before last years Award season didnt really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended but whatever maybe for exposure at the least but the movie was a convoluted mess Sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all There was not one person that I could connect with and I think that is where it failed for me Sure the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology WOW What a grand idealets see if that already hasnt been mined to the point of futility The whole ordeal feels fake from the lighting the casting the screenplay to the horrible visual effectswhich is supposed to be intentional I can tell and so can everyone else no one is laughing with you though Anyways I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least I wouldnt want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed But its tripe either way Boring tripe at that,0
This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a Friday the 13th 1980 clone The poster for this movie makes it look like theres going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy which is likely to attract moviegoers There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie It just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers 1988 on video or DVD and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing moviebr br Angela Baker Pamela Springsteen is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble Meanwhile the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with Angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home Could Angela be the killer who was once a man who underwent a sex change operation years earlier Who knows Who caresbr br The 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genres in which a mad killer goes berserk Some have a plot some dont but theyre all about as bad as this one Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed strangled impaled chopped up burned alive and mutilated Thats all this movie is It is just mindless bloody violencebr br Watching this movie I was reminded of the Friday the 13th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves Imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers The world is a totally evil place this movie tells you and itll kill you It doesnt matter what your dreams or your hopes are It doesnt matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend It doesnt matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are You can forget those plans because youre just going to wind up dead br br And the sickest thing isand by not giving too much awaythe movie simply sets up room for a sequel Well why not Theyve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp 1983 and after watching its first sequel I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original And for parents if you know kids who actually LIKE this movie do not let them date your children,0
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen At first i thought that it was going to be good because Im interested in the bermuda triangle but instead it was terrible All it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didnt make sense if time moves differently there how come the woman didnt age and her son aged rapidly and have a horrible sappy ending Next time the guys who made this go to Bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them Please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list,0
Lame ripoff of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT 1955 the first half is deadly dull even dreary but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging monster In the accompanying featurette a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes when compared to the ones created for the other titles in Criterions Monsters Madmen set director Day who admits to not being a fan of the scifi genre tries to justify the films shortcomings by saying that he had a zerobudget to work with where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footageand Id have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had I not recently watched CALTIKI THE IMMORTAL MONSTER 1959 a similar and similarly threadbare but far more stylish venture from Italy br br Bill Edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut obsessed with achieving the titular feat is positively boring at first but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood Marshall Thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is OK as a leaner Glenn Ford type he had previously starred in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE 1958 another and more successful Richard Gordonproduced scifi which incidentally is also available on DVD through Criterion Italian starlet Marla Landi struggling with the English language makes for an inadequate female lead even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value br br The Audio Commentary is yet another enjoyable Tom WeaverRichard Gordon track where among many things the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was intended as a doublefeature with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD 1958 is brought up but it was eventually put out as a standalone release so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race its also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by Bonar Colleano who tragically died in a traffic accident prior to the films release Weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the DVD featurette shot by of all people excultish filmmaker Norman J Warren Landi who by then had become a lady of title was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs Edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but once in London he proved reluctant to cooperate with Weaver eventually the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and in fact he died in 2002,0
The idea behind this movie was great The story of a little girl facing abuse both emotional and physical and trying to deal with it and survive What makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog The actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again Also there is very tedious almost funny overuse of metaphors in the voice overs The high point is the acting of the little girl Nice try but this ones a stinker,0
Dear God I kept waiting for this movie to get started then I waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither I just sat there dumbfounded that 1 it could possibly be this bad and 2 that I had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity I had faith that Drew couldnt possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy did I ever lose my faith Dont bother with this one Drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived I cant believe a script this bad ever got funded It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it STILL didnt go anyplace Its just pitiful Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasnt the worst baffles me Because believe me if it got any worse Id have slit my wrists before finishing it,0

As a fan of Henriksen I liked him in the Millennium series and of course Lorenzo Renegade Lamas I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film Sadly the plot is predictable the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts dont work out Sometimes it even looks like theyve captured some shots from Microsoft Flight Simulatorbr br The cinematography sucks as well Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts from the cheesy dialogue and gives the film a cheap madeforvideolook It works in hiphopmovies and Jet Li movies but seems out of place in this flickbr br I would have liked this film 10 years ago I was 11 then,0
In theory films should be a form of entertainment While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of filmmaking most movies specially genre films must not only tell its story or message they must entertain their target audience in some way All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or lowbudget a bad movie is one that is boringbr br Hellborn or Asylum of the Damned as is known in the US is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving and irremediably boring and tiresome While it has a very good premise it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesnt make things better On another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic Bmovie but here it is just a bad attempt at filmmakingbr br Director Philip J Jones tells the tale of James Bishop Matt Stasi a young psychiatry resident who just got his dream job at St Andrew Mental Hospital but the old asylum seems to hide a secret After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices James decides to find out what is going on only to find the incredulity of his boss Dr McCort Bruce Payne who believes that Bishop is going as insane as his patientsbr br While the premise is quite interesting the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every cliché of the genre Of course there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichés but in Hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving resulting in a boring and predictable storylinebr br The acting is quite mediocre for the most part with one big exception Bruce Payne gives a topnotch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performancesbr br Despite all this flaws one thing has to be written about Hellborn it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day bigbudget Hollywod horror productions Also the makeup and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good Sadly the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated making a huge contrast with the makeup prostheticsbr br Hellborn is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results Hardcore horror or bmovie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience 310,0
Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day steals the body in his fake ambulancehearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep Belas wife eternally young Some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible terrible mystery Bela Lugosi hams it up nicely but you can tell he needed the money br br This film is thoroughly awful and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous Tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for 1 which I think is a pretty accurate valuation anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind,0
What the hell was this Ill admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere he goes but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell For crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller I would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get We just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a midlife crisis and his journey to redemption Kinda like an oldman flick if you ask me I probably should have just rented Wild Hogs it wouldnt have made a difference I mean who are we kidding they should have made someone else the killer of that girl By juxtaposing Sparrow with the protagonist of that book The number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along How would that have shaken our heads Shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who concurred with my reaction,0
doesnt mean this movie is good i was really frustrated by it on many levels its kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski hey ive read that guy in collegelets see what matt dillon does with him and i like matt dillon i thought he came close to looking a little like hank but mostly just the ruddy cheeks i have to care about a character though and there just wasnt much here to care about i think time might be cruel to bukowski and that bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time hard to sit through scenes that went nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit i ask for very little got less,0
My roommate and I have another friend that works at a local Blockbuster Video He finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them One of them was a Christmas Horror film starring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as a killer Satna Claus We didnt watch it immediately but we didnt think there could be anything worse Apparently we were wrong We were shown this slasher film starring Ken Shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow At first we thought Ken would actually BE the killer scarecrow and thats why we wanted to watch but he wasnt and that made the movie even worse What absolutely RUINED the movie was the teen drama If you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head NEVER EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE,0
This movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters This was a Nickelodeon Production and it would have been better if they had released it on the tv station The animation itself in some parts was ok but the plot was horrible A classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention This was not the case with this film There were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without,0
Detective Tony Rome Frank Sinatra returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time its a film thats played for erm laughs While on a diving trip Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles Theres even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality its a shameful shambles,0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen The story line is a joke the effects are terrible the cinematography doesnt fit the tone of the movie the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest People just dont act that way in real life situations My question is Who would fund such crapbr br The movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them Next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes One guy falls and breaks his leg or something The fireman arrives to help them Meanwhile somebody starts a fire Some more bike stunts Bla bla blabr br I wasted my timebr br Do not watch this movie,0
The somewhatbelligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way by acting out but that Dad is morose and blaming himself Writerdirector Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams characters with question marks hanging over them and then lays all the storypoints out in the most obvious terms Suicide Secrets Gay shame Family sickness Ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow Harris wants to make sure we dont miss a trick initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary sentimental fashion Sigourney Weavers bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and shes a joythat is until Harris gives her a makeover complete with sensible new hairstyle Its the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head from,0
I havent had a chance to view the previous film but from what Ive read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one although I doubt that is possible Im a huge fan of the Zombie genre and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures that for all intents and purposes are human as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head That said HOTD 2 takes the Zombie movie to an all new lowbr br Without giving any big spoilers which I really should do just so you wont bother wasting your time actually watching this movie I would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries Special Forces Gomer Pile could have probably survived longer than the Spec Ops soldiers in this film For crying out loud they should have called them the Special Education Forces instead If you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses I understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basementbr br The writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more hightech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for and the idea has merit if it wasnt stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making I mean come on zombie films arent exactly high art and the viewer expects some tongueincheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters If you are a zombie movie fan like me please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one,0

Wasted is just that a waste of time MTV is churning out made for TV movies at quite a clip nowadays A friend of mine recommended this and i rented it needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore recomendations from her anytime soon This movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use The problem is you really dont care about any of the characters due to lack of believabilty and their own self discipline This movie is in a word annoying to watch from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing The digital format tries for realism but comes up distracting If you want a true scope on drug use watch Requiem for a Dream,0

This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that Freddys Dead is It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time It was boring pointless and nearly death free The horrible 3D ending and overthetop CORNY kills are enough to drive this film into the ground However it doesnt stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and youve got yourself this heaping pile of guano Its no wonder why Freddy as always played by Robert Englund has made two postmortem appearances I would too if I went out like that This is a strictly fans only movie dont stare at our shame,0
like in so many movies of the past you would think Hollywood would learn this by now makes for a very disappointing movie not to mention make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransombr br Maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us Why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost Just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the endbr br I had to listen to part of the directors comments in the special features section from the great moves that Redford has made in the past Sneakers for one surprised he agreed to star in such a film The directors comments and reasons were weakbr br The best parts of this movie was the scenery cant wait for spring to come,0
When I saw this in the cinema I remember wincing at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene then immediately telling myself no this has to get better It didnt The performances are pretty uniformly teak n pine and no there is NO sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever just the awkward posturings of a reasonably comely discreetly talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of Interviú and not much else besides If the scriptwriter thought that making Mérimée a character was a stunningly original creative ploy he perhaps ought to get out more And Aranda if hed given the matter a bit more thought would have realised that the story of Carmen is just CRYING OUT for a thoughtful iconoclastic parodic deconstruction not this leaveyourbrainsattheturnstile affair of ersatz passion and comicbook dialogue This is contemporary Spanish cinema at its worstbr br,0
Having read many of the comments here Im surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a Twilight Zone episode from 1960 called Mirror Image starring Vera Miles Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending but in a feature film there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense Sadly substance and sense are two things missing from The Broken Yes it has some moments but they are not enough to justify your time Some further observations although this is clearly a contemporary story not one character in the movie has a cellphone And even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going there is never any reference to an insurance company to the person who was driving the other car or to the police who would have been required to do a report My advice skip this bore and watch the original instead,0
The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns Christopher Lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is Father Pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine The cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting The film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a worldisdoomed sort of way and the production is adequate Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie Meda Band Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Bands assistant Bennah Burton Despite its plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it,0
It would be a shame if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come Oh yeah the public will say Comanche Moon thats the mini series about the Texas Rangers and the Comanche Indians that starred Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval It was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in I think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy I really dont understand why they agreed to be in it That would be such an injustice as the original Lonesome Dove was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and Jones and Duval will be remembered for it,0
I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through since I had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own but I came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money I had paid for it If you are a fan of gore and sadism this movie is OK If there is one thing that the makers of this film know it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect If that doesnt thrill you then stay awaybr br This movie is shot on a home video camera with grade school props and terrible actors Its dubbed from German but even allowing for that the sound is awful This film is about as budget as budget gets except for the aforementioned special effects If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts the film might have been a little more enjoyablebr br The story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tinmasked sadists They are captured and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape I call this a story in the loosest sense since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenityfilled dialogbr br There is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie unless you like mindless gore Consider yourself warned,0
This is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a Africancentric over the top airliner They even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport One day this guy wins 100 million dollars a the next time you see him he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport Everyone calls this movie a parody but nothing about this movie shouts parody This movie is a flop and will forever be in the 495 bin at WalMartbr br I cant even come to terms to why MGM would waste 16 million dollars on this movie This movie doesnt even warrant straighttovideo status The writers one black and one white should be blackballed from Hollywood forever Not only do they overstereotype blacks they portray them as ignorant human beings I would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me Dont waste your time at the video store walmart payperview or on a Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS,0
Ive noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how wholesome and entertaining it is These people need to get out of the house more often I dont know why theyre shilling for this vapid insipid brainless piece of fluff Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his costar Pamela Austin a former model yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day A good supporting cast TerryThomas Edward Everett Hortyon among others tries hard to make some sense out of this but to no avail I noticed that two directors shared credit although credit isnt the word I would use neither is director As for wholesome entertainment there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this Find one of those films and skip this one,0

The cars in this movie are awesome The acting in this movie is awful The plot and driving scenes dont make much sense and are equally bad If you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster save yourself the trouble and money Good movie for racing fans Well there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver If you cant tell the difference go watch it youll have a blast It really comes down to this there are really really really nice cars in this movie they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic The acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot If you want to see hot girls turn on mtv or vh1 instead I am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie If the class of the cars were to match that of the movie they should be racing with rusted bicycles,0
Warning Spoilers following Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place Other than that libelous scandalous Filmed in Canada presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring Susan Sarandon of all people I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary Kenn Borek Air,0
This movie makes me think the others Ive seen with Combs were an accident The plot had more holes than I think Ive ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a b movie The acting was so laughable that not even the memories of Combs past campy triumphs were enough to save it Considering the script I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas I am thoroughly upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of Avoid this movie no matter what,0
I saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list and while Im glad I saw it because its now another Video Nasty down on its own merits Andy Milligans film really isnt worth bothering with There are of course far worse films on the infamous list but that doesnt make the pain of viewing this one any easier The film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget and that has translated into the script as Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema and doesnt do anything new with it Basically the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will Its not long before they start getting picked offblah blah blah For most of the film nothing happens and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned theyre so amateurish and silly that theyre impossible to take seriously on any level Its a very good thing that this movie doesnt have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture It all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending which also succeeds in being a nonevent of epic proportions Apparently this movie is still banned here in the UK but somehow I doubt its because of its shock value Basically Blood Rites isnt worth seeing and I personally can see no reason to recommend it Unless of course youve made it your business to see everything on the Video Nasty list,0
I was Stan in the movie Dreams Come True Stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming where was the ambulance The acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the Fox Valley Wisconsin I saw the movie on the big screen It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen I may be bias but overall I enjoyed it Also the soundtrack was the band Spooner who later became Garbage My brother Steve Charlton was also in the movie He played Swenson the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police,0

Id give this film a 110 This film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current skin trend in Bollywood movies Id definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie What really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like Yash Chopra Films ever succumb to such an awful production They have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than adult audience too which when exposed to these sort of gross moviesmay wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognitionbr br On the whole films must not only be entertaining but also must comprise of some sense as well Certainly this film is an immense disappointment to Yash Chopra fans especially me myself I am really disappointed over the plot acting and everything else Why cant people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films at least for once throughout the film The point is clear Id like to put my opinion in short Horrible Disappointment Lot of Adult Material Lack of sensible substance Lack of normal psyche Worthless Could grab a Cornetto or a Temptations chocolate instead,0
I was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary The content is poorly produced very poor quality video and especially awful audio Theres extremely little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music The interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are adhoc mostly inarticulate mumbojumbo Too much yak and not enough Haack Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span even for slow andor difficult subject matter I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts I slept through If you watch this make sure that you are set up before viewing like Alex in A Clockwork Orange Bruce Haack deserves much better than this Shame on the producer and director,0
Maya is a woman without any interests She just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled This could be an interesting topic That would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues It doesnt have any of these This movie is totally boring There are only lengths and no climaxesThe only climax is Shahrukh Khan But although I am a huge fan of his I couldnt stand this movie Even he cant make this movie exiting The movie is not as bad as King Uncle and if youre an Arthouse fan or like it slow you might maybe like it Its not funny its not interesting its not catching My recommendation Dont watch it,0
This is a bad movie Not one of the funny bad ones either This is a lousy bad one It was actually painful to watch The direction was awfulwith lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at alland I cannot believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard If you havent seen itdont You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults This one is just a waste of time,0
This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent Full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense I cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 My guess is they are stooges of the movie maker br br If I could give this movie a zero I would Too bad IMDb doesnt allow that br br The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it Whats sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed Take my word dont waste your 8 on this piece of trash The only entertainment I got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name In all highly NOT RECOMMENDED,0
It started out with an interesting premise I always like Civil War stuff and ancient secret societies The more the film progressed the more I realized that this was a B movie at best In the latter half it quickly became a C movie then D then F then I wish that this wasnt a rental so that I could put it in the microwave I cant say that the acting in all cases was awful just most The writing however I never read the book Maybe the book is well written The screenplay was written by a 10 year old It was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer I really hated this movie as did my wife I am a Christian and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity This movie did a great disservice to the cause Awful terrible worthless If you liked it I strongly recommend Superman 4,0

Bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film The kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are splatted everywhere so much so that you really arent supposed to see them as human The yawns between the lines from Wayans and Sandler are extensive indeed They try hard but alas and alack persona itself does not a good film make Jimmy Caan plays a nifty villain but hes always had that redneck edge at the ready My favorites scene is the repeated clips of a TV ad in which Caan reveals the virtues of America can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage Aside from that its a buddy movie with guns for brains Pass on this one,0
I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned From the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fictionbr br Its bleak depressing and hopeless While I dont mind a less than cheery ending Im really very tired of the humans suck cliché thats central to every movie I know you cant get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of selfhatred as a member of the human race but hows bout as a writerdirector we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil Right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim til your arms are tired This way you wont be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive Its silly not thoughtful and boring,0

This movie has made me upset When I think of Cat in the hat Im thinking of cat in the hat books You know the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children Well I though that this movie would be a lot like that But much to my suprise was nothing like the books Insted it is more like young adult humor movie In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool hoe cat talks to it like it is his hoe agin adult humor the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie under the rating youll find mild cude humor and some doubleentendres I think in short this means adult humor I wish I could return this movie walmart said they wouldnt because the movie has been opened If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy,0
Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonards Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene He was memorable in Domino Sin City Man on Fire Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler 2008 we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter Whenever we get to know him Rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ballbr br This is an Elmore Leonard story and production Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 310 to Yuma Be Cool Jackie Brown Get Shorty 52 PickUp and Joe Kidd This means that we get tough guys some good some not so goodbr br It also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation weaving complications into violent conclusions Killshot is no different Tough slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men It is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good If you like those two including David Cronebergs equally wonderful Eastern Promises you will like Killshot alsobr br Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies His last few were enjoyable if not successful Proof Captain Corellis Mandolin and Shakespeare in Lovebr br Diana Lane hasnt had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun Here she is right on mark balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tensionbr br This is a small part for Rosario Dawson Yet Dawson does a good job with it You see a lot more of Lane including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shutbr br While you are in the crime drama section also pick up Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Gone Baby Gone and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman Ethan Hawke Marisa Tomei and Albert Finneybr br Killshot flopped at the box office More is our luck It is certainly worth a 34 dollar rental if you like this genre 6202009,0
The long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous John Mills didnt bowl me over to the extent that I couldnt judge the film on its actual merits It is FULL of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer The music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end I thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued I found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons prenose job with a rousing little ditty I cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great I found it maudlin mawkish and minor,0
I love the Jurassic Park movies they are three of my all time favorite moviesbr br And I hate this game if there was one game I wish I never own for the Super Nintendo was this onebr br How can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful And to make it worst I was scare of this game when I was a kidbr br How dumb was that but then again I was a kid when this game was first outbr br The game play in this game is just odd One minute its a action game and then its a shooter What in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video gamebr br The Sound in the game is just terrible to listenbr br The music is just too sick to listen tobr br The Controllers in the game dont work most of the timebr br Jurassic Park the game is just a waste of time and money and wont be a classicbr br Avoid at all cost,0
utterly useless having been there done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect It may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire unrealistic drivel So many cringeworthy scenes that would put The Office to shame not a compliment to this film It also may have helped to have some semblance of a story a point a message a commentary anything Seriously Kevin Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this film term used very loosely in this case There should be minus numbers reserved for films like this 10 extra turd,0
Wild Rebels is fun in a bad way but also frustrating due to the actual good or at least workable elements in the story It deals with a race car driver Steve Alaimo who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called Satans Angels who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank Meanwhile Alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the Angels are up to and where theyll rob next Its not even that the film is really too dated though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film from the band on stage in one scene to Alaimo performing if you could call that drek that to the regular generic score br br Its just that theres not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic direction and better actors for the parts As it is I didnt have a major disliking towards the film as I did with the Hellcats but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all too What could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the Florida town Citrusville hoho So its not completely unworthy then of its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status as of late The commentary is good on the movie even if once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth Wild Rebels might be more of a good time if youve got a sixpack and low expectations but as it is I wouldnt watch it again,0
If this is someones favorite movie they need some serious help There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest I havent seen the original movie this is the remake of some 1950s film but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardizationbr br A major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element and winds up teaching children at an ROTC school Unfortunately the major is Daman Wayans so the children are in for a world of annoying humorless asininity Can Wayans whip these losers into shape Can they get him to become a little more human The film bombs as most Wayans films do with only a few sparkling moments William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time fair too little This charming old man known best to me as a Tales from the Crypt actor known best to you as Uncle Louis from Christmas Vacation shines every moment hes on screen which isnt much herebr br Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker which fits him perfectly I wouldnt mind slightly more Bam Bam but I think he carried the role of biker about as far as it could be carried for a military filmbr br And then theres the attractive teacher who someone falls for Major Payne even though he treats the kids poorly has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate Im not sure which though it would seem stupid since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enoughbr br Wayans had one shining moment a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves including a very nice robot and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew This scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittlebr br Seriously avoid this film If you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes rent or buy Ernest Goes to Camp At least hes a lovable loser and actually funny Maybe if Major Payne had fought a badger Id feel better but he didnt Forget Payne forget Wayans you can do so much better,0
I concur with the other users comment Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80s I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture dont always match up If anyone can truly say this is a good movie they need to be locked up It is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it I feel I lost intelligence from watching this I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad I bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for 999 and I can honestly say I would have been better off literally throwing the money away Forgive me Jesus,0
Ive seen my share of Woody Allens movies and while theyre not always great you can usually be sure youre going to be entertained Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway 94 and Mighty Aphrodite 95 since then the ones Ive seen have been patchy but watchable And so when I was invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda which I wasnt even aware had been released yet I went along happily I hadnt really heard much about it so I hoped I would be pleasantly surprisedbr br What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie Ive seen The premise is overexplained the cast is terrible the script is slow and lifeless Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out I assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short filmbr br I dont mind the concept behind this film two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy and obviously the film proceeds to show us that by playing out both scenarios The problem is neither of these two films are any good at all The comedy isnt funny and the tragedy isnt very tragic It seems like Allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam or time to actually complete the filmbr br The general level of acting is notably bad also Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table and its basically a Woody Allen impression Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny just come off as annoying and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell as Melinda which is a shame because her character is in nearly every scenebr br To be fair to the actors the script they are working with is lacking if not nonexistent Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall,0
Im not sure this film could ever match the first one even if it starred the original seven notwithstanding the fact that four were killed It just doesnt have the spark and chemistry All the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecksbr br Its interesting how Yul Brynner is magnificent in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel Yet when he stars in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s his character in the same matching black pants shirt and hat evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 films Chris Adamsbr br Theres nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching even on cable,0
Im not going to say that this movie is horrible because I have seen worse but its not even halfway decent br br The plot is very confusing I couldnt really figure out what was happening and where things were going When the movie was over I was left scratching my head I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two br br Character development is very shallow I couldnt figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone I couldnt tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them This film seems to be based around stereotypes to its credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which SHOULD make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean Stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters This film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possiblebr br Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation I guess thats OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really didnt get a chance to know any of them so I never really missed any of thembr br And last but not least was Sadies singing Its awful The music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from Sadies vocal cords I swear that theres one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off during this howlathonbr br As a whole this movie is confusing Characters are illdeveloped Georgias acting is wooden and stiff Sadies character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation The music was unbearable and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain,0
Appalling shallow materialistic nonsense How women and gay men can enjoy this rubbish is beyond me No selfrespecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold diggers What is even more concerning is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show If that is the future of women Lord help us all Showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not be about spreading your legs every three seconds with a different man I think this demeans women and does not do them justice But this review is no rant against women Fans of this show say it is hilarious and rivoting but every time I have watched this show I have just struggled to stay awake Despite the narrative of the reporter woman at no point in this show is there even anything close to something that could be considered a rational thought So its not entertaining and its not informative so why would you bother watching it One out of ten stars,0
We sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie what does this have to do with the plot We hoped that by the end everything would be slightly more clear It was not to bebr br I think the director in a fit of pique threw the script up in the air and then some minor and vengeful underling reassembled it randomly with no regard to the scene being filmed possibly with scissors and gluestickbr br The films motifs include Communism bad Nihilism bad Poor parenting bad Threesomes bad TV bad Coherent scripting bad Deconstructionism good Its really not clearbr br Finally no German water taxi would EVER have an unchained staircase that would let passengers fall in to the water The abundant quantity of achtung signs everywhere is testament to this fact,0
On the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there Mary Richards Mary Tyler Moore and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern Valerie Harper meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up on each others lives What a novel concept But sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years So instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner The supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone Moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself If this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like Its not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work At one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors Or for that matter among potential audiences Quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic,0
Could be considered some mild spoilers but no more than in anyone elses review of this filmbr br I knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original Carrie which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire Carrie White was victim epitomized and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feelbr br Whoever conceived the Rachel character for The Rage must have completely missed the subtleties of Carrie For the audience to genuinely share the victims rage she must be a sympathetic character a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of hisher own vices Rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spaceks Carrie And she looks and acts like she should be right alongside the attractive and popular brigade that she ends up torching She like the rest of them has a soul that is every bit as corrupt whereas Carrie was a complete innocentbr br It just doesnt work Theres no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children not even the Home Improvement boy getting offed in this movies climactic scene And its so unnecessarily gory There was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym br br And there is one person in particular that this movie should NOT have had the audacity to kill off but I wont say who it is If youve seen the original Carrie its the sort of character who dies unjustlybr br At least they DID create the connection to Carrie appropriately its explained as it should have been But that and the arm tattoo which was done rather nicely is just about the only thing this movie has going for itbr br Yet another hideous Scream knockoff and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made br br Rating 1 out of 10 I wasnt expecting much but I was still horribly disappointed An unsympathetic character a series of irritating popculture references thrown in for no good reason and an ending scene that pales in comparison to Carries gravestone shocker,0
I had high hopes for this movie The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies br br I am a fan of a lot of Belgian movies but this movie is bad Its completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers The linguistic games were hideous and over the top Nothing about the film seemed real to me The ending was way too deus ex machina for mebr br I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half of my life,0
I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place but Baba was a huge disappointment In between an awful storyline the action and songs were only mediocre The storyline becomes very preachy Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadus next big guru My wife tells me that since this film came out Rajni swore off doing any more moviesbr br We were lucky initially to have bought Babu an oldie by Sivajiganeshan online by accident when trying to buy this onethat was a great film which made up for having bought this dudexcept it makes Baba look even worse by comparisonbr br Bryan,0

Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point the little Vasque town of Obaba In this film the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum The result is a strange film as it has any main character the movie spends about 20 min to each tale other than the town of Obaba Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring It was by far the best film of the year in Spain but well thats not saying too much The only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios It is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story,0
Im a huge fan of war movies and as a Vietnam combat vet have some experience with the technical details I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them Other vets and Iraq vets in particular have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well Poetic license is one thing but this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it No bomb disposal unit or any unit would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reasonit saves lives The opening scene particularly annoyed me The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately Yelling Stop dialing is not an effective deterrent It got worse from there The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious As others have noted your average EOD guy doesnt know jack about being a sniper and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldnt happen Somebody might shoot him but this kind of risktaking is limited to the movies I could go on but as I said others have pointed these things out in detail This is not a good movie and if it wins any awards at all its a further reflection of why La La land is so named,0
If you liked the first two films then Im sorry to say youre not going to like this one This is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video probably TV made sequel The still idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski Rick Moranis is still living with his family and he has his own company Szalinski Inc Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue Wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother Then he shrinks his wife and sisterinlaw too Now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger Pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things eg a toy car roller coaster swimming in dip etc Pretty poor,0
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny Most of the movies they parody doesnt even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it Non The main actor was well cast in it but thats really the only good thing about this film Also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage Thank goodness I only spent 4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on ONly watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes,0

If you havent figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes Lilia is a widow She has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out She has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never daredthe cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her The film is very misogamist Its portrayal of men is dismal Which is rather odd as Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it When she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again She does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention The other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is shortlived Not short enough I say She does find romance however brief with you guessed itNo surprises here we didnt see coming Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way Maybe this film just isnt targeting my demographic 30 Male,0
First of all I do not look down on Americans I know lots of people that are intelligent people from the USA But this Movie is so utterly bad that i just had to comment on itbr br First of allMovies are mostly far from the truth This movie is no exception Lots of scenes are so incredibly false For example the departure of the 2 space ships You see them drop off the full tanks in space Just a small distance from each other Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past Just a tinsy winsy part that came off In here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship What idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time Second of it is that the Russian station is a piece of scrap I hate to bring this up to you but astronauts nowadays go to Russia Since their equipment is much more reliable then NASAs The Space Shuttle is retired And NASA uses it just to pay off the bills And there is no better alternative for it And the list of whoppers goes on and on This is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious And i know half as much as these guys do But the most annoying part read the whole movie is the Propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with MY GOD I thought i was looking at a CNN business commercial for like an hour The actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with start up fights ignore the police etc etc But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it bomb detonator Maybe i lack the feeling of being a true Patriot that can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili Whilst riding with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart driving in circles until the battery is empty But this movie was too much for me too handle And when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney I realised that i was glad this movie was finally done I do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded stereotyping propaganda movie But i pity them This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power As long as Uncle Sam thinks you are a good patriot Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated no one cares,0
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya I do not like his singing too But his songs are a craze in India especially among commoners Now when he ventured to become an actor that was a big joke What guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time I did never want to see this movie But one thing changed it The movie becoming a superduper hit After 2 weeks Aap Ka Saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores compared to Apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks If I can sit through Apne and Rajnikants absurd Sivaji I should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit The story is about the real life singer Himesh Reshamiya HR who has gone to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya Hansika Motwani A German lawyer Ruby Mallika Sherawat loves Himesh Now Himesh is arrested for a murder The mission of Himesh in last 40 minutes after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murdererbr br Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero He tries hard but fails miserably He is pathetic I was thinking what could have made the movie click so much Let me find something positivebr br First the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point Himesh runs away from the jail But after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits Second the songs of the movie are good catchy crowd puller numbers Third Mallika Sherawat she looks gorgeous and acts well too as the second lady I can imagine fans of Mallika coming to see the movie just for her Fourth the cinematography of the movie is pleasing especially the German locales are a treat to watch for the eye Fifth the major portion of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya with clichéd dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd Sixth the Director Prashant Chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of Himesh as much as possible with shots that dont need Himesh to act muchbr br The heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a small budget film heroine Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role Overall the movie is a below averagebr br I was thinking throughout the movie what if the same movie script was done with Salmaan as the main lead I think it would have had been a much better affair May be then I would have given the movie 6 out of 10 But now Stars 45 out of 10,0
Even for a tired movie model as the nature vs man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effectivethough entertaining for reasons it was not intending It is sooooo preposterous Apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites hundreds of these bites being fatal Watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a notsogoodbut verybad way So many scenes just look ludicrous a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked Suzanne Sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through pieces of wallpaper Bernie Casey faking a gam leg and the list goes on and on The peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls The cast for the film is not bad on paper but none of these actors seem to believe in the material Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror I hope she found a good use for the money for it is obvious that was the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense Although it is quite a bad film it is watchable once for me and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities startstudded actors embarrassing themselves that madeforTV feel and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man This time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected Really quite dreadful,0
The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment onbr br This film is asinine Its like so many other 21st century grind house fodder The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting I didnt care about any of the characters but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap Id complain about the money I spent but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining Live Free or Die Hard which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of Captivity for 40 minutes,0
This is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original This sequel isnt nearly as fun as part one and it instead spends too much time on plot development Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry The performances are all adequate but this time the script lets us down The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting so I need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a Trancers movie Unfortunately the laughs are few and far between and so this film is watchable at best,0

Today I found They All Laughed on VHS on sale in a rental It was a really old and very used VHS I had no information about this movie but I liked the references listed on its cover the names of Peter Bogdanovich Audrey Hepburn John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it I searched IMDb and the User Rating of 60 was an excellent reference I looked in Mick Martin Marsha Porter Video DVD Guide 2003 and wow four stars So I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it Indeed I have just finished watching They All Laughed and I found it a very boring overrated movie The characters are badly developed and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story The plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but I have not laughed along the whole story The coincidences in a huge city like New York are ridiculous Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt Antonio Banderas or George Clooney is quite ridiculous In the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in Star 80 and Death of a Centerfold The Dorothy Stratten Story the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen the future Mrs Keith Richards the always wonderful even being fiftytwo years old Audrey Hepburn and the song Amigo from Roberto Carlos Although I do not like him Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60s and is called by his fans as The King I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly Dorothy Stratten My vote is fourbr br Title Brazil Muito Riso e Muita Alegria Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness,0
It amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this Really Lets forget for a second that the plot doesnt even give a single hint of originality Most of the movies today are based on other movies stories so a simple lack of originality is not that big a deal br br But I can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this Because lets be honest that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous To be sincere I think a 6yearsold child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable Some examples followingbr br The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane When they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like Ok push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard Now those are not buttons They should not be pushed they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot Thats something only planeaddicted would know you say Wrong The next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons And of course the so called buttons dont move at all Not even a single millimeter And note that I havent even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine that you just turn the key and the magic happens You have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on Come on guys You could have faked the movements at least Not to mention the hilarious final impact where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway Light poles along the runway What where they thinking And the wings dont even get ripped off It happened to me too once Except the plane was made of Lego What about the flight attendant Shes actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit Should we mention then the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer And how did he turn the other airplane engines onbr br Really I could go on hours with this stuff This is the dumbest movie Ive ever come across and Im including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list Want to do yourself a favor Dont watch it,0
i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free thank god had i paid for it my review would be less forgivingbr br well the major idea of the film geeky girl takes bloody revenge isnt all that original there are several parallels to carrie playing a mean practical joke on a loser except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her tamaras and carries bad family background i still think its a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didnt take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong thingsbr br what worked i liked the actress that played tamara she looked great when she was hot and her catty lines were fun Sean cant come to the phone hes fking patrickbr br what didnt work the whole wicca thing was silly i generally prefer rational explanations she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue pleasebr br the whole idea wasnt bound for Oscar buzz but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had it was bearable but far from good,0
Yes this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles Shot in Toronto its yet another 80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants Into this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take Maury Chaykin and Chopper the local crime lord Robert Davi Stir in the local dogooders priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences Davi is the standout amongst the cast and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job Otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that wont satisfy action fans and will leaves Sayles admirers slackjawed,0
Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen The acting the dialog the manuscript the sound the lighting the plot line I actually cant say anything positive about this although I enjoy Swedish movies The fighting scenes are so ridiculous that its impossible to take it seriously And when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar Im not sure if its supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film Regina Lund is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions It leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this,0
I am an actorproducer director and what i am about to say are facts This project was the worst film in movie making history From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke Why would Blockbuster released such crap I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession Was the director trying to make a bad movie I dont think so I seen bad Zombie movies but this takes the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table THIS MOVIE SUCKS I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession I respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK I mean the makeup on your girls the scary Zombies what were you thinking To the whole nation if i could have voted Zero i would have WORST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY,0
Good movies are original some leave a message or touch you in a certain way but sometimes youre not in the mood for that br br I wanted something simple no thinking just plain action when I watched this one It started of good and was quite entertaining so why a bad review Well in the end the movie lost its credibility The storyline wasnt that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was OK so more than enough to satisfy my needs But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the no thinking just plain action category So in conclusion if you know youll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical dont watch otherwise Id say go ahead,0
Its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s but its true Here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story Irvings original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge One can either completely rewrite the story a la Tim Burton which is a discussion for another time or pad the bustline of the old girl with unintended detail The latter is what is attempted here and if I may say pitifully so Unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones ruin the storys intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers By the time the tales famous climax approached I had completely lost interest Its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background,0
What a drawn out painful experiencebr br Thats over two hours of my life I will never get backbr br This Film Festival Directors delight is awash with overuse of the long slow shothowever thats not the only thing that makes a scriptbr br Avoid this movie at all costs,0
Ladies and Gentlemen may we present the worst of all Disney remakes Although the name of this movie is That Darn Cat it should have been That Darn Teen or FBI Agent The cat didnt get any real good scenes Riccis character was more annoying than funny Doug E Doug didnt get any good lines even Dean Joness cameo role couldnt save this movie The only really good characters were the towns only two auto mechanics but their scenes were only brief In all Id say that if you are considering watching this movie go get something more intelligent like a Barney video,0
I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie The Christmas Box based on the book by Richard Paul Evans I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life After seeing this movie I was so disappointed As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop I had a few calls after the movie each call the same That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back What a bunch of bull It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark I guess thats Hollywood,0
Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jailIf so this is your movie This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd That would be ok but the story was poorly executed Contrived plot twists poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot linethe faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint Later the same hotel employee is somehow foundand Bangkok is a big city mind you Ive been there and testifies against the girls as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison Cmon Rent Another Day in Paradise instead,0
Alien was excellent Many writers tried to copy it They all did a bad job or almost But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy Because of the bad actors the bad special effects the BAD scenario and other bad stuff it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film The movie wasnt very long and this is a very good thing the only one You cannot laugh because it is too seriousthat is a bad thing because in almost each Bseries scifi film you can laugh during the whole time It can be terrific sometimes but instead of watching this stupidity just watch Alien or Event Horizonthese are much better I give it 1 out of 5,0
The man who gave us Splash Cocoon and Parenthood gave us this incoherent muddle of cliched characters poor plotting youvegottobekidding dialogue and melodramatic acting I guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then Hes allowed,0
Theres hardly anything at all to recommend this movie Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this clunker is a waste Unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre In a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference No such luck here Creature Unknown a clichéd monsterontheloose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other The monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of Paul Blaisdell So bad its good The rest of the show is just so bad its bad A little humor might have made this more palatable but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up There is a twist or two at the end but by then you wont care anymore,0
Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy Sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land How did the dierector get it so wrong Well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché but somehow cuteor is that cliché piled upon cliché No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sants GERRY and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didnt get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the unrequited loves a bore theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they refilmed half of it got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and heyprestocomedy tonight A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform I can understand why,0
My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video Although it had great actorsactresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest Plus it just wasnt that interesting Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburns last movies Ill always love John Ritter best in slapstick He was just too pathetic here,0
They should have named this movie Blonde women that needed to get their roots colored Also the main character geeze the too tight sweaters The giggling Thought the guy did a good job though I keep hoping well find a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week The dart throwing Had to laugh at that too Weve still got 3 more on the DVR to watch maybe well get lucky Oh yeah I figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin I told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery And how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them Creepy,0
Granted this seems like a good idea Steve Martin Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy Where can you go wrong Watch the movie and youll find outbr br In truth Martin the lead is miscast Hes not doing the great slapstick hes known for from movies like The Jerk but instead plays a sort of inbetween character that doesnt work Hawn with no one to play off of is terrible Cleese is the only even partially funny memberbr br To top it off the plot is pretty stupid I cant say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense They blunder through New York not doing anything right and unfortuneatly nothing funny Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who dont live in New York arent very bright a theme repeated throughout the moviebr br In summation instead of seeing this go rent the original Odd Couple again,0
I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed and of course Sir Anthony Hopkinsbr br If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie this would be the end result I dont think Ive seen a movie like it that made an LSD trip look like an episode of Sesame Streetbr br Its a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality or various realities and the film doesnt culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes where all of a sudden it makes sense I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away and I wont do that here Its a well acted piece of cinema and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins and let me say this if theres one redeeming feature to this film its the music It fits perfectly Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good and unbelievably bad all at the same timebr br I enjoyed parts of this movie I truly did and once you get to the end of it youll actually figure out whats truly going on Its unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point which minimizes the effect of the entire moviebr br I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isnt the acting its everything,0
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr doing in this Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools While the topic is one that needs to be addressed the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick The characters are cutouts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14 With them it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems For anyone older it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning as I did recently on Bravo Matter of fact what was this doing on Bravo,0
There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it shortbr br The Grinch I thought was marvellous Jim Carrey is a truly talented physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor in my opinion Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying I used to like him very much in his Waynes World and So I Married an Axe Murderer days but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and the Cat In The Hat has just finished me off br br This film was horrible the gags were horrible inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years The plot was messy messy messy Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was Mom They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin but he could have pulled it off if it werent for Myers ugly revolting overacted portrayal of the Catbr br I mean did Myers even glance at a script Was one written The other actors seemed to have one but the Cat just seemed to be winging itbr br On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous But unfortunately they cant save this filmbr br Poor Dr Seuss the man was a genius Dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy messy waybr br 110,0
Im surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks My thought about this film was that the target audience is adult and male Whipped and tortured women merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients introduced into film history by the spaghetti subgenre The opening and the handsmashing are DJANGO ripoffs THE SHOOTER however lacks the style of eg DJANGO Score acting and cinematography are mediocre at best but if you look for the above mentioned ingredients you are in the right place here And the actors dont have an Italian accentbr br 4 10,0
Just how bad Well compared to this movie Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane Theres the stilted acting the atrocious dialogue the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done Unlike Holocaust Ferox is a straight forward movie It doesnt pretend to be a pseudo documentary In some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocausts graininess Unfortunately we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible They torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves Theres really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while I was fairly lenient with my review of Holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style but in Feroxs case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore,0

I bought this it was only 3 ok under the title Grey Matter The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a nonDukesOfHazzard role intrigued me As the other reviewers warned its a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awrybr br And yes there are plenty of establishing shots especially of a house with a pool in front of it Some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript I guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings Its actually kinda funny After awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channels station identification logo reminding us that we are watching Grey Matterbr br I also enjoyed two bouts of namecalling At one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a Scientific btch Its just a very inadequate insult Several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that scientific btard It just sounded very awkward to mebr br Someday this movie will disappear forever Another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it Almost like it never happenedbr br,0
Teenage Exorcist is one of those Godawful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics adolescent humour and empty writing This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sadehmmm once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon Her sister and brotherinlaw along with an Irish priest her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy try to save her and exorcise her demon Well not much here in way of horror or suspense In fact one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect Mikethe girls brotherinlaw has tied herthe name is Diane by the way and she is played by Brinke Stevens up after trying to chainsaw her sister He removes a gag from her mouth and says something like This wont be the last gag we see tonight Indeed it was not The special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal Some of the lines and situations are funny Robert Quarry old Count Yorga himself really steals his scenes as an Irish priest He hams it up wailing Biblical verses and crooning Irish songs You know you are in trouble however when Eddie Deezen gets top billing Deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler Michael Berryman from The Hills Have Eyes also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film As for the other thespians well they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre Stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and Frenchcut panties but beyond that dont expect too much more from her Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun and she shows a bit more than Brinkea very lovely young lady by the way and out acts Brinke by miles Her husband played by Jay Richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity Again not a bad film to waste a little time that involves NO thinking on If you are a Robert Quarry fan watch it for his performance at the very least,0

I will not say much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much there to talk about The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from Atlantis The Lost Empire are back Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters it has horrible comedy horrible animation and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful one and only Michael J Fox as Milo James Thatch The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were and never should be animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible and finally why would somebody who did wonderful voiceover work for ObiWan Kenobi in Clone Wars want to copy Michael J Fox I happen to have an answer to this Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II Yes sadly it is truebr br,0

This is one of the worst films Ive seen for years The storyline has potential that is never realized The actors are a poor choice but considering the screen writing their talent isnt wasted I really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so I could get out and watch something else Unfortunately I did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmurs of people moaning about how crappy this is There wasnt booing after all this is England just gentle moans about how crap that was Then I look on IMDb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10 I really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score They must be a PR company working with the distributor Theres a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film when in the graveyard and the hick attacks look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched supposed to be a brick wall the blood effects are waaaay OTT the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the Director,0

Ugh Even the everpopular Diane Lane could not save this movie and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if Rourkes face would move One has heard so much gossip about his botched face lift etc so like an accident on the side of the road we just had to slow down and see the wreck The plot was thin Here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punkcrook and throughout this movie were wondering why this guy stays with this idiot let alone gets together with the guy in the first place Then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses He would have popped them right then and there But then we would not have had a movie then would we And why did the realtor even agree to the extortion There were more holes in this flick than in my colander The acting was horrid the entire movie predictable down to the minute and even the ending And so much could have been done to make this a much better movie But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not have to use any brain cells in the process then this movie is just what the doctor ordered,0

I had nothing to do before going out one night so I didnt want to watch anything too heavy I picked the perfect film This must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone she slept with the director Raja Gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious In what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling They let kids all come to the prom with no shirts in skin tight leotards ass shorts and one girl was dressed as Eve wearing only fig leaves She announces that shes 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying The newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesnt realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment They allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to HS with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use I would not get in some kind of trouble NAHHHH No problem Didnt she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point The secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype Jessica Alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance In what world do the parents not get suspicious when their ubergeeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom And they dont ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history If some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life This movie is so contrived and predictable its nauseating and why at the end is everybody the Alpo girls included cheering for this chick when two days before they hated herbr br DUMB DUMB AND DUMB,0
but had to see just how bad it could get The plotline was thin to begin with but it just kept getting worse A female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed off 97 of the worldwide male population The surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the Lesbian Conspiracy The entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby Not only that but he will age to mid 20s in a month and then begin to age normally how convenient Eventually poor Adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to see the citybr br This begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases convenient plot twists and several subplots that we never see resolved As Adam quickly learns what men did survive are treated as outcastscriminals because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence The propaganda machines have been in full swing scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers This has led to lesbianism being the norm the fall of Christianity female only reproduction via cloning and oh yeah world peace among other implied results All of which seem unlikely given that only 30 years had elapsed since the war Adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next all the while being genetically programmed to be nonviolent and unable to really do much on his own behalf With the FBI on his trail madams looking for fresh meat and his creator trying to recapture him for herself it seems he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after allbr br All in all I would not recommend this moviebr br I did however enjoy Veronica Cartwrights portrayal of the love to hate her Director of the FBI and Julie Bowen didnt do bad as Hope the closet hetero geneticist either,0
The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable The characters are believable and interesting The cloning lab looks really hightech After that it all collapses The characters start behaving idiotically and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor and this is supposedly present day going critical the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon only it doesnt The finish is incredibly weak One wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrongbr br All the characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians This results in some weird situations and details like the character being played by Vessela Dimitrova being called Bailey Kent despite her heavy accent and despite her on one occasion inexplicably switching to Spanishbr br Because of the decent start I considered rating this movie a 5 but it really was more disappointing than that so I only give it 4,0
I a huge fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and still am But I was very disappointed when i began to watch this new seriesbr br Children under the age of 15 or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best and possibly new fans who havent seen any of the original series But as far as fans of the original series will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the 1st seasonbr br I would only recommend this series for people who havent seen much of the original series people who are under 15 and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fans everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about Russel T Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV shows,0
I went into this film expectinghoping for a sleazy drivein style slice of seventies exploitation but what I got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action Its clear that this film was made on a budget the locations are drab and poorly shot while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also The plot focuses on a trio of robbers a father and two sons that steal a load of gold after killing some miners They come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmotherand all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl currently residing in an asylum Its clear that directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were making something really shocking but despite its best efforts South of Hell Mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer The film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and longwinded dialogue The only good thing I have to say about the film is with regards to the music which is good in places The ending is the only other good thing about the movie and thats only because its the last thing that happens I wouldnt recommend anyone bothers tracking this downthere was much better trash made in the seventies,0
Looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform However I was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story David DuchovnyDr Eugene SandsConnie Carla04 was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine Dr Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina JolieClaireTaking Lives04 who immediately becomes attracted to Dr David Sands Timothy HuttonRaymond BlossomKinsey04 plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed Gary DourdanYatesCSIVegas TV Series plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a socalled body guard for Raymond Blossom Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men This film is not the greatest but it does entertain,0
This was one of the worst films I can remember seeing I am sure I have seen worse though if that mitigates me slamming itbr br The humor isnt funny there are stupid stereotype jokes that again arent funny I was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film It was a complete waste of time I enjoyed Martin in earlier films but not this one Same for Queen Latifah she was excellent in Chicago and in Set it Off she was good too but this role was horridbr br I mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script I feel strongly you cant save a formulaic unfunny script with decent actors this movie as a case in point Still all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film I am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted made released theatrically and promoted,0
First of all let us discuss about the story It is a copy of the movie Hitch with an added Indian Flavor to it One guy who is a Love guru and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story Salman Khan is the love guru and Govinda is the lame guybr br Now coming to artists performance Salman Khan overacts throughout the movie he tries to be funny but fails big time You can see Salman shouting throughout the movie no real acting is seen in his performance Govinda pairs opposite Katrina KaifOh my god she is one heck of a girl A real Beautyis in real life a 50 year old dude and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties In the movie Govinda looks like Grandpa of Katrina Kaif What a pity Coming to Execution of the movie This movie feels like a BMovie and a poor imitation of the movie Hitch Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth this movie is shallow and purposeless nowhere there is justification or claritybr br Just forget this movie for it is nothing but boring typical Bollywood fare Actually I give 310 because this is the lowest I go,0
I got to know ÆON back in the early 90s via television and I loved itbr br What did you like about it The cranky drawing style The flawless artistic action involved The absurd and deadpan communication between the characters The whole layout of the surrounding future world No matter what you loved about itbr br The Aeon Flux film of late 2005 has nothing of thatbr br Karyn Kusama the so called director of the film was hopelessly overstrained with transporting the original content to a new film If you re not familiar with the original series you wont understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the filmThe story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the filmbr br Kusamas attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller its simply unworthy of the original ÆON conceptbr br Charlize Theron might be an attractive woman but she cant impersonate the ÆON character Although she was attached to strings doing action scenes her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film The result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physiquebr br Forget about all the rest its not worth talking aboutbr br I give 1point for MsTheron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film Thats it,0

If this film becomes a holiday tradition I am going to have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life How do you even think of comparing this with A Wonderful Life It was absolutely awful The boy singing made my toes curl And what on earth was the deal with his hair Emmy worthy performance Please Granted Lucci did OK but an Emmy I think this film is a waste of money The fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse It lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts Lighting wardrobe makeup it seemed everybody wanted to go home Just a big NO from me,0
This movie is supposed to be taking place in and around Seattle The why is Porteau Cove PROVINCIAL Park shown Provincial parks are in CANADA and not the United States The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with stylus to read that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced We learn halfway into the movie that this woman works in the District Attorneys office Then in the correctional center a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender This would NEVER happen in a real correctional setting The director really messed on this one this doesnt happen in real life The acting is adequate The Plot is good The Cinematography is good However the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote,0
I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontës novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas But Im very disappointed I never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel hadbr br First of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if its been written for a contemporary horror filmand like another commentator I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors Ive seen some scenes filmed that way in North and South and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant its definitely overdone and simply annoying Camera movements cannot make wooden acting livelybr br Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity None of the characters were properly introduced at first The little boy gave a very good performance hes very cute and the best feature of the filmbr br SPOILERS Tara Fitzgeralds characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through She doesnt seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way I just couldnt believe Markham could have fell for her and Im not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband Fancy being married to such a virago Besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me Toby Stephens I found just OK Helen Grahams brother not very good br br Maybe its difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty Besides what is only hinted at and left to the readers imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when Huntingdons eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for a period drama I mean dont we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas,0
The gate to Hell has opened up under Moscow A priest played by Vincent Gallo goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway Wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic Good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting Ive watched this twice now and I still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms Nothing is clear and honestly I didnt see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved Second billed Val Kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that dont amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film The idea is really good the performances are fine the script goes nowhere Take the advice of several of the characters in the film and dont cross the river to see this,0
Warning Spoiler I have to agree with you it was almost there This was such a bad movie about such and interesting true story It had such promise but the acting was ridiculous at best Some sets were beautiful and realistic Others are something out of a theme park I found myself laughing as I watched what was suppose to be serious scenes I really wanted to like this movie but I couldnt The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the King dying I liked the Queens punishment And the final shot made a beautiful picture though There are so many better movies to watch I dont recommend this,0
I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982 I remember dialogue from Tatum ONeal that was just amazingly bad I remember Richard Burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me In short I remember Circle of Two because it was so phenomenally awfulbr br This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality Recall The Blue Lagoon and other Brooke Shields annoyances Lipstick Little Darlings Beau Pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults As a teenager during this time I found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speakbr br Circle of Two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like Blue Lagoon In fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way But honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful No one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again,0
and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle So no problems there for most males out therebr br I watched it as one of those bundled together package Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible Just to give you a sense our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles Again no complaintsbr br The fight scenes are laughable and borderline on the pornographic Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie On occasions when she has to fight the fighting involves rolling around in the dirt grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens I am surprised no hair pulling is involved It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the combatants that I said the one that draw first blood wins in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fightingbr br The witch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast From being a big cuddly bear in the beginning he became manic depressive when captured and then outright psycho He spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevancebr br Beside Liana our heroinebouncing around topless you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons Yeah it is that kind of moviebr br Watch the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory Despite the movie being more than 20 years old the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old,0

This movie which I just discovered at the video store has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor Its easy to see why The story of two friends living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island has flashes of being a very good film but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel rather than on their homeless friend Richie Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it with the ghostly images of Coney Island However writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie One flashback in a music store where Richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone But in the end not much Two many drawn out scenes of annoyance such as inside the Skeeball building RATING 4 out of 10,0
How viewers react to this new adaption of Shirley Jacksons book which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie true enough will be based I suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this oneand those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of Hollywoods current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is are going to love itbr br Things I did not like about this adaptionbr br 1 It was NOT a true adaption of the book From the articles I had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to And that seemed reasonable no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND And not even then But there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING I didnt like that either What the movies press release SHOULD have said isWe got the basic very basic idea from Shirley Jacksons book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading characters names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first and decided to throw in a bit of them toobr br 2 They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad No instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fearlike lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experimentnice guy This doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from daybr br 3 In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened thereand this time around Nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of THE CHANGELING The only problem was the socalled mystery was so incoherently told that Im sure it remained a mystery to most of the audiencebut then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH Its first victim died before ever setting eyes on itbr br 4 The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was a true skeptic of its historyand in this one he was just a wineyvoiced bumbling nerd who couldnt sleepinsomnia remember and was a compulsive liarbr br 5 I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with Nels sisters family and Mrs Dudleys little opening speech to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING Its like it couldnt make up its mind what it wanted to dobr br 6 I missed Nels narrative through the whole movie The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through Nels eyes and we always were privy to her thoughts That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine The original Nel was not a bad person but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister and she liked to moan and she lost her temper This one was almost too good to be true This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writers had obviously been watching GHOST one too many timesbr br 7 They changed the history of the house and its occupents too much There was no Abigail Crain the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no nursery There was also no Grace wife of the original doctor and Hugh Crains wives died in totally different ways These changes changed the story WAY too much I dont know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they shouldBE SORRY if ya get my drift The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled withbr br In conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie This movie should be burnt to the ground and the ground sprinkled with salt My favorite movie of all time remains so No competition from this one,0
I just caught Farewell to the King on cable and maybe its just because Im a girl but I thought this was on the craptastic side The script and direction are pretentious once I found out John Milius was responsible it all became clear The supporting actors actually werent bad James Fox was outstanding The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte who I usually enjoy Once he goes native he starts speaking a very stiff stilted English and half the time he seems kind of distracted as if hed just smoked some of the bounty of Borneos rain forest And then the end what the Learoyd just happens to be on the same boat as The Botanist by the way had the Botanist dumped the girlfriend or what The boat just happens to run aground conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy Anglo exheadhunting Army deserter,0

This movie could have been a lot better than it was if hadnt been a Disney Film I thought that the young girl playing Shirley was all right you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right The teenage Shirley Temple wasnt right at all I think that they should have spent last time on her childhood the first hour should have been about the young Shirley then the last hour should have been about the older Shirley This was a boring movie and not a good Shirley Temple story,0

I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie He came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories bad camera work and a walkthru persona he nearly lost me A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie Now hes forgotten again This film is seriously dark on any level you care to name There is a lot of slash gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless its meant as a warning against the militarybr br Seagall may have had a standin for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone elses voice was used most of the time Sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused Theres lots of gore if you like that king of thing It looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time Im just glad they didnt suck the blood from their hapless victims I harken you back to my summary Basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action filmDec 62006,0

San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits In this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city They didnt even manage the most basic of realistic details So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie You will not be thinking oh Ive been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrapstinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby Some of the leads used East Coast speech styles and affectations It detracts but the acting was always competentbr br The stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting The plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy Hong Kong action movies The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminariesbr br The white boy intro was pointless I think the filmmakers didnt know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows its not groovy to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous They threw away some good opportunities Educated and embittered on the West Coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable That would have been interesting this was notbr br The Hunters Point intro was the most disappointing It was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco Youve seen it done before and youve seen it done better Even the video game was better br br Despite the generic nonlocality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending Good concept placed in the wrong handsbr br PS there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one,0

This movie stinks majorly The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming Its total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings This is by far THE worse anime that came out of Japan I cant believe they actually put their names on this garbage What a rip off selling this thing for 20 If you havent seen this dont bother If you have I pity you,0

There are two kinds of 1950s musicals First you have the glossy MGM productions with big names and great music And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast less famous music and second rate directors The Girl Cant Help It belongs to the latter category Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond OBrien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her well never mind Seems like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons The plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one cant help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino Little Richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie If that music appeals to you this is worth watching If not dont bother,0
Okay people I have to agree with almost everyone elses reviews here The characters Are Stupid Theyre ALL stereotypical and yet have nice clothes and are always skinnybr br Dont even get me started on Jamie Lynns role as ZOEY Zoey is a pretty popular tan blonde young teen who everyone just LOVES She has a rebellious great personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is Most annoying of all her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious OMGbr br Take for example the first episode The moment she steps onto the huge PCA campus everyone seems to love her The boys want to ask her out the girls want to be her friend etc Thinking shes all that the episode plays out with Zoey always being the center of attention she is the socalled best player of the unofficial girls basketball team confident and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face Oh boohoobr br My favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show Lauren or something who is the ONLY person ever introduced in the show to hate Zoeybr br And Zoey doesnt even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes In one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without EVER apologizing and doesnt show the least bit regret in doing sobr br Zoey is ALWAYS the bestbr br Desiging professional Tshirts and backpacks which become a big hitbr br coming up with VERY elaborate schemes BY HERSELF to teach a single person a lesson br br Flawless grades br br Taking the blame for stuff that wasnt even related to her just so everyone else could be happybr br Coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on TV The list goes on and onbr br Ugh She has no acting talent Shes always the perfect person She acts snotty and rebellious and preppy andUGH Cant stand herbr br Not only that but everyone in the show always has great clothes EVEN THE NERD Her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty freaking decentbr br No one cares if everyone at PCA loves you Zoey and would do anything for you even if it meant giving their right armbr br BUT regardless of these cardboard characters the plots are creative Not everyday things Theyre interesting and amusing The humor is usually goodnatured and fun but the characters are so paper flat that its hard to enjoy itbr br This show would be really good if Dan Schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted because they are so typical so boring thats its lame and stupidbr br Point No ones the least bit overweight everyone has stylish clothes Zoey is the definition of Marysue the story lines are wellthought out and the humor is laughable But again I want to emphasize that the characters taint the show Watch the show if you must but dont say I didnt warn you if your eyes start to bleed,0
If Alien Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea add a lot of sugar and youll get this one down The film begins in jolly old England around 1100ad and then jumps to present day California Our hero Carver Dean Cain is the new Security Chief and Military Advisor for a Science Lab 400 feet underground He arrives Carver is also a helicopter pilot with the lead Scientist and we soon find out its a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone Is it a Dinosaur or what As with the above movies all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a direct to video movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before Again dont go in with high expectations and youll be ok,0
Id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie Ive ever seenbr br I have no idea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing I can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditionsbr br 1 While being shitfaced stoned out of their minds 2 Theyve received hard cash for the votes 3 Under gunpointbr br I cant believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie,0
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad This movie has terrible everything The dialog is corny and cliché the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didnt make the soccer team This is so bad its funny to watch If you can catch this on lifetime Id recommend it highly as a comedy As for being a serious movie Im afraid ill have to rate this a 2br br Dont watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting There is none to be foundbr br Edit Hmmm I think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down Dont believe them This is a really crappy movie,0
when i first read about berlin am meer i didnt expect much but i thought with the right people the right locations the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about but eissler failed its so ridiculously unauthentic its a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlins so called scene of course its not all about hippness but you should expect more from a movie thats being sold as the definite berlin moviebr br and apart from all the credibility stuff it really is a bad movie mediocre acting and a rather boring plot interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented so it really must be poor directing skillsbr br dont bother watching berlin am meer unless you are 17 come from some small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool,0
I got this thing off the scifi shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I was a kid Id rented the second one and it was a decent B scifi This one was out right obnoxious The special effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done The two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they came on the screen The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick I dont know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but Im sure that theyd have done better to have left it at 2 movies The movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible I only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device,0
waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played Heath never gets work again On top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap 02 out of 10,0
There is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst I have seen in some time As F Scott Fitzgerald Gregory Peck and Sheilah Graham Deborah Kerr are lounging on the beach suddenly things become tense and Sheilah begins to cryat which point she tells her lover about her sordid past This dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I couldnt help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all wasas dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo NO ONE experiences moments like thisno one Now how much of the rest of the film is true I cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 Rolexand leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correctthe film is a lot of bunk However I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didnt seem to clear this up either br br Just who were F Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship really like What I do know about Fitzgerald however does seem different from what I saw in the film Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film Well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish Id assume he wasnt Was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film Perhaps but if he was this bad AND yet Ms Graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete dummyand not someone youd like to see featured in a film And if he wasnt then the film does a poor disservice to his memory Either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experiencebr br The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people In a dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way Unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place The bottom lineits a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your timeeven if like me you are big Gregory Peck fan,0
This type of plot really does have a lot of potential but it was butchered here Honestly I sensed the cheese element in the beginning but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing Whoa I was wrong So mad scientist makes a monster wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them but of course they escape After that its really bad I shouldve counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage but I most likely would have lost countbr br Pan down to the blooddrippingfromseveredleg to show us how the sharkman finds the folks I hate being spoonfed every aspect of a horror filmbr br Oh and after being nearly killed by a mutated sharkman and trudging around a jungleesqe island theres nothing more cheerful than a middleaged man reciting Shakespearebr br This is one where youll find yourself rooting for the monster if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick,0
This series had potential but I suppose the budget wouldnt allow it to see that potential An interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the 1st episode The whole series 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90 minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward The music was very annoying and did not work overall There were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame well one grew a bit The ending was as terrible as the rest of series The only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element,0
Independent film that would make Hollywood proud The movie substitutes good looks for good acting a cryptic plot for a good story line and selfabsorption for character development May be I missed something go see it for yourself,0
Most of you out there really disliked this movie you were right A small minority of you really loved the movie cant say you re wrong For me this movie was too stupid I have seen many dumb silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them As I was watching I couldnt stop rubbing my eyes not believing what I was seeing and trying to decide if I should laugh or cry as REALLY STUPID stuff were going on on the screen and people were leaving the theaterbr br According to the leading characters time travel is accomplished just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past Plus if you are seeking an after death experience just go to the nearest planetarium there you shall meet Lord sorry Loydd and be given important commands All te above doesn t really make sense right Well go ahead watch the movie I almost never regret the movies I watch you probably wont like it but you will be intrigued by the writers ability in producing the ultimately STUPID scriptbr br I m giving it a 3 out of 10 not good far from being the worse,0
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn A sick film that was NOT funny and was NOT worth the money any money at all If anybody ever wants to see this movie dont Your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week So if you value your childs education and want to stimulate your childs mind please dont see this movie I beg of you DONT,0
I purchased a DVD of this film for a dollar at the big dept store Thats probably the best and kindest comment I have to offer on it At least it didnt cheat me out of the cost of lunchbr br The problem with Chiller is Cravens problem as a director The man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove hes a really smart guy and allaround sharp conceptualist But its no secret that as a director he has never possessed one iota of the visual and storytelling sense of a Hitchcock As vigorously attested by Chiller hes much closer to that legendary flatfoot Hershel Gordon Lewis What Craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film makingbr br Lets be specific The transitional moments of this film are sleek The establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production The film looks professionally put together in the way a film shot by a TV commercial director would A thought The films only visual distinction these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors Its the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions the drama that fall flat br br The core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled The critical shots after say the departing car drives into the wellpositioned camera then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital then to the waiting area and hallway then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part Craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment The net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts and the fumbling rush to keep things moving is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils fussily adjusts his easel and lighting setup grinds all his pigments stretches and primes his canvas and then has nothing to say Craven like the art student never gets to the meat of the exercisebr br For Craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for TV I will point to Spielbergs Duel and say no more,0
To review this movie I without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in Tarantinos Pulp Fiction 1994 when Jules and Vincent are talking about Mia Wallace and what she does for a living Jules tells Vincent that the Only thing she did worthwhile was pilot Vincent asks What the hell is a pilot and Jules goes into a very well description of what a TV pilot is Well the way they make shows is they make one show That shows called a pilot Then they show that show to the people who make shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if theyre going to make more shows Some pilots get picked and become television programs Some dont become nothing She starred in one of the ones that became nothing Now to stretch on what Jules was talking about there are BILLIONS of television showspilots that were never aired because they simply were notwell good Probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is WALTER a spinoff to MASH with Gary Radar Burghoff as the lead Hmmm would somebody really want to be watching Radar for a halfhour trying to solve crimes Hence the show was never picked up What many people dont know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air for they are made strictly for the Television networks for them to decide Some have made theyre way past and got onto the air The pilot for the animated series American Dad comes to mind as the shows serial itself didnt begin until nearly four months later However there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air and this here is whybr br Black Bart a supposed tiein with the Mel Brooks comedy classic Blazing Saddles is a stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul Saddles was a controversial comedy nevertheless with its racist humor and vulgar comedy which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make a great television show FOR PRIME TIME TV I say supposed because none of the memorable characters from the movie aside from Bart on in this mess of a TV show Mel Brooks wasnt even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line In a related story I recently found out about an unaired TV pilot for a series based on the movie Clerks that Kevin Smith was no involved inyou see what happensbr br Set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all the story circles around the only Black sheriff in the wild west named appropriately Black Bart who is this time played by future Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr obviously before his stint in real acting whereas in this he is playing a Grated Richard Pryor Most of the other characters are carbon if not really bad copies of the characters in the movie Jim The Waco Kid is replaced by a similar looking character named Reb Jordan a former Confederate soldier who is quick with the gun Lilian Von Schtupp is now Belle Buzzer a more of a ripoff of the character being that shes a show dancer and a German with a Marlene Dietrichtype accent and personality While thats pretty much the end in similarities The lead bad guy in the story is Fern Malaga played by Noble Willingham who I assumed wouldve been Hedley Lamar if Warner Bros secured the rights to the name See trivia for Blazing Saddles and his son CurleyI dunno Taggart I suppose The story is a poor excuse for a sitcom much less a pilot Bart deals with the mayors drunk son and hes outofcontrol behavior which has caused the town to spin Really its a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and doesnt focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show I cant really call it a sitcom and even if I wanted to and thats primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at Warner Bros Studios and later added a laugh track so the show is set up almost exactly like MASH complete with a bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series The acting is soso but theres one part that always make me laugh and thats when the actor playing Reb Jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue HA The script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie Surprisingly they use the word Ner numerous amount of times through a 22minute episode rather touchy for its time period and even for today and it gets repetitivebr br If you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of ssssssurly interesting novelty item watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots Its on the collectors edition of Blazing Saddles God knows why There yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tiein pilots never air,0
Oy vey Jurrasic Park got Cormanized As usual the plot is wafer thin from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs Ive seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film All the male actors are imbeciles thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for Fredricks of Hollywood The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins from the movie of the same name it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the motion shots If you want a good movie to sit around and heckle MST3K style this is gold If you want competent film making and good acting dont watch a Roger Corman film Acting gets a 4 out 10 some of the players upon this stage did try Story gets a 2 out of 10 it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad Special effects gets a 2 out of 10 Ive seen worse but not many,0
After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction moviegoers There are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for prepubescent teenagers Todays well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors Asimov Heinlein Bradbury and Ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement In doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them They are not critical for its own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye As they should as Hollywoods record has been less than stellar To these fans the story must take supreme importance They cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudestbr br The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre Look at many of the above comments that state Well I havent read the book or anything by this author Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel They are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects They are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie Case in point I Robot While supposedly based on Asimovs short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations Those of you that will run out and buy I Robot will be very much surprisedthis movie isnt even based on that story at all br br The film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity I wont point them out I wont spoon feed you You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself The characters which are named after many of Asimovs characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories The plot itself with all its action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future In short other than the name their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie There will always be those uncritical ie unthinking who will state The movie doesnt have to be like the book Due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start What if all they took from the written work was the title This begs the question Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping its title on your vacuous piece of crap Save money and dont buy the rights to the works Title it something else Dont use the characters names Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism In fact it wont matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him But it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show br br I Robot like much of Hollywoods take on the genre pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago Hollywood could not do this alone It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this,0
I was expecting a very funny movie Instead I got a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just didnt work I didnt like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes and Moriartys descendants It was confusing It would have been more funny if they just had someone new instead of Moriarty resurrected Some of the things were funny Burt Kwouk was very funny as always McCloud on the horse was funny The McGarrett from Hawaii 50 was not even McGarrettlike Connie Booth obviously is very good with accents She is from Indiana but played English and a New Yorker pretty well Unfortunately she was not presented much into the script I was expecting a more funny film Instead I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script Rather ironic since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one Maybe they were about to break up in 77,0
I am not an artistically inclined individual I am a science minded woman and I felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget I watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest My fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to Oceans 13but that is another story Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot I began again watching this movie in earnest I just dont get itI thought I would get itI thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers Interesting and still it had dead stuff inside It was an odd and bizarre movie Maybe this is what they were afterhowever I wont be tricked a second time,0

About your terrible movie copying Beethoven As a professional musician its my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites When Hungarians and Americans meet its a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible You proved it in your terrible bmovie The only thing that carries the movie is the music Of course you didnt bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the Tackacs quartet but OK I have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie youve made It starts of with the dying DEAF Beethoven who perfectly understands Anna who is merely whispering Beethovens hearing during the movie gets better by the minute but that must be because of some vague divine thing Then there is the quite impossible semipornographic eyes wide shut doubleconducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious Anna and the crying nephew in the end who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes my GOD what a performance And as culmination the ripoff from Amadeus with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes but in total nonsense which she understands perfectly but noone else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand Of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason This so called homage is blasphemy and I am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though its about my favorite subject Ed Harris and others you cannot comprehend the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing Thats the trouble with you Americans you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work Yeah we can do it anyway Remember that a good product comes with hard labor talent devotion and professionalism All these you creators of Copying Beethoven lack See you in kindergarten,0
Last weekend I bought this zombie movie from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of Land of the Deadbr br Boy was I wrong br br It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the coverart which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genrebr br We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cellphone They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him but once they started driving the car I couldnt suspend my disbelief anymorebr br Some people actually consider this a so bad its good movie they are liars I didnt finish the movie but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way throughbr br This is even worse than Zombiez DO NOT WATCH,0
I often feel like Scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or I write the review to balance unwarranted raves I found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fastforwarding not only through dull clichéd dialog but even dull clichéd musical numbers Whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thoughtprovoking plot development Individually June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people but cant carry a movie as a team Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal Theyre both bland I like Billy Gray but his character is pretty onenote The best part of the film to me are June Havers beautiful costumes and great body,0
Recap Full moon A creature a huge werewolf is on the hunt Not for flesh not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though but for a mate He is on the hunt for a girl Not any girl though The Girl The girl that is pure and also a werewolf although she doesnt know it yet Three well check that two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf This particular powerful werewolf Darkwolf is closing in on the girl If he gets her mankind is doomed Now the cops has to find the girl convince her not only that there is someone a werewolf nonetheless that wants to rape her and perhaps kill her but that she is a werewolf herself And then they got to stop himbr br Comments This is one for the boys the teenage boys A lot of scenes with seminude girls more or less important for the plot Mostly less Well I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin And unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking One usually turns to two main themes Nudity Check And then special effects Hmm Well there are some things that you might call effects Theyre not very special though In fact to be blunt they are very bad The movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds They couldnt afford clothes for some of the girls and the effects are cheap Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form obviously done by computer are really bad You might overlook such things But the Darkwolf in itself is very crude too and you never get to see any killings Just some mutilated corpses afterwards And there is surprisingly little blood about in a movie that honestly should be drenched in bloodbr br Im not sure what to say about actors and characters Most of the times they do well but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it A few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above Like the poor effects or the poor budget That could explain why there is precious little shooting even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving But hey when youre in real danger there nothing that will save your life like a good onelinerbr br Unfortunately that cant explain moments when the Cop Steve the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem the werewolf that is runs away when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is just beside him now and that he cannot let it have her But sure it let the makers stretch the ending a little morebr br But I wouldnt mind seeing none of the lead actorsactresses get another try in another moviebr br Well To give a small conclusion Not a movie that I recommendbr br 310,0

Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable I think not Basically the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing ever comes as a surprise It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama its a failure This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely I mean no way this could ever happen in real life as in the same way as the events occur in this movie So the movie has a real suspense and credibility problembr br But it truly are the clichés that killed the movie It was cringing stuff at times Everything is so formulaic in this movie The predator is portrayed as a cool heartless almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman who acts like she didnt see any of this coming Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason Such as the sequence in which the predator fixes the victims broken car That has got to be one of the oldest clichés out of the book I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point The movie is filled with moments like thesebr br The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie Which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary subplots to make the movie even more drama likebr br Ill admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good acting in this movie She makes some of the clichés and events look even almost realistic at times Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie Showgirls so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one Its a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better All of the other characters are a disappointment Corey Sevier plays the cliché pretty untouchable rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse He looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence He wakes up he wants sex Before he goes to sleep he wants sex He gets home he wants sex It might be a realistic thing but I dont know it just didnt feel right for a movie like this one and the story in generalbr br A cliché filled movie and I cant think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie Its predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility Not an horrible movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and cliché elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable onebr br 410,0
Quirky independent theatrical Christian Slaterthese are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so discovering a jewel of a film Boy was I disappointed Julian Po never gets over itself The film is relentlessly selfconscious I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment The overdone obviously theatrical sets the overdone obviously theatrical acting the overdone obviously theatrical directing well you get the idea br br Allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style And its hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him The ridiculous girlfriend the annoying townsfolk the idiotic clergyman the bratty kids why would anyone particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside Slaters character decide to stay in such a dismal place,0
Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it That raw plot line is Ill admit a pretty good idea Although this show was meant for children a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws First Zoey is a cliché character her being super popular super attractive super smart and theres nothing wrong with her no girl is like that It feels like the show was put the spotlight on Jamie Lynn Spears and increase her fame Dana who appeared at the beginning of the first season is just plain mean However in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of them all which is sad seeing that Dana is never nice Nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead but mysteriously gets straight As Lola seems to be able to fool anything with her Emmydeserving acting skills Quinn is supposed to be super smart and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things she is also made out to be weird and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart while Zoey Lola and Nicole get guys and theyre all beauty and no personality Chase and Michael are very similar and I even sometimes get them confused Logan is unrealistically rich and hands out millions like theyre dollars Nobodys that rich Ive also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that Stacy girl who does nothing but act nice to them Thats not funny Thats mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people Finally the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5star amenities such as a scenic location sushi bar hot lounge equipped with free soda machines pooljacuzzi movie theater and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sexs dorm rooms At most boarding schools if a boy were to go into a girls dorm or vice versa they would be expelledbr br In conclusion Zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process,0
This movie is terrible it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people the movie didnt show any convincing argument to prove that And the rest of the plot didnt make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense br br The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother the most annoying character I have seen for a long time br br The acting and scenery were OK but the plot ruins everything full of cheap clichés and hypocritical scenes I expect not to see this movie again in my life Skip this one,0
Where to start If this movie had been a dark comedy I would say it was FANNNTASTIC Unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare mind you that was the price I paid got it from WalMart this movie was meant to be a thriller The only THRILL I got was watching Kirklands lousy rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy woodland area If you want a good laugh on a rainy Friday night with some friends then I highly recommend this movie But if you want to watch something at least half way decent then dont even botherbr br I for one enjoy crappy films the worse the better in most cases But Wow I Meant WOW The only person in the entire film that didnt stink it up was the little boy played by Vincent Berry The only reason why I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do,0
Oh dear god This was horrible There is bad then there was this This movie makes no sense at all It runs all over the map and isnt clear about what its saying at all The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman The fact that Edison isnt a real city takes away Since I live in Vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable Why didnt they make it a real city The only writing that was decent wasTilman in which John Heard did a fantastic job He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout Too bad Hopefully someone important will see it and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the A List,0

An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive I challenge anyone who is a Aliens James Cameron 1986 Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbagebr br Cast members such as R Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead Jack Scalia was really absolutely horrible I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John TolesBey who must look at this movie and just wonder Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting moviesbr br But on this movie The script as I said earlier was a ripoff of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine thriller It included such lines as I got a bad feeling about this and Kill me as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the alien hop just before it pops out of his stomach There is also a ripoff of the classic get some via Bill Paxton We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie Aliens And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid as opposed to having acid for blood There are many more major examples So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens With Sigourney Weaver Youll have a more enjoyable timebr br The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasnt very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not The whole command structure between crew and Capt was poorly done Im not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples like dive depth etcbr br If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you As for me this one is going back on the shelfpermanently,0
This is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of Rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends If you find Rome an abomination a foul mouthed screwfest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy Imperium Augustus But if you feel Rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factorsbr br There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome I especially disliked Romes image of Cleopatra as a drugsoaked sex addict There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in Imperium suits the part much better OToole and Rampling are good and so are some others But then If you have come to know and love Atia as the super cool bitch youll find the depiction of her in Imperium as a tearjerking mother goose in an apron absolutely ridiculous There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Imperium but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more Youll find no interesting female characters in this epic Theres also the painfully comic Maecenas whom we see as a screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such hes once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annalsbr br The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés upon clichés Cleopatras big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a childrens play room in an Egyptian theme park Theres a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphics not up to 2003 standardsbr br The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Augustus is reliving So we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the eternal flame of Augustus This affair doesnt sizzle for even a moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tearinducing musical score Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non English speakersbr br Everything is lukewarm in this epic True there are more historical accuracies than in Rome but dramatically speaking its plain boring The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness Camerawork is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eyebr br Theres really noone to love and noone to hate in Imperium Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome there are much better films and miniseries around Ancient Rome The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend,0
This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites Castle Freak himself is a good monster I would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me However the movie had some dumb parts about itbr br A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness but youd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind All they care about is that JJs dead While their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how shell never be able to drive a car The parents are like honey stop walking around without a guide you know better than that and then they cry and dont ever stop being depressed because JJs dead Sounds like favortism to mebr br The lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done For example when a giant crash is heard in the castle everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was It was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered The husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says The mirror broke I dont know I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castlebr br The husband and wife have some major relationship problems and its funny to watch how dumb they are with each other No one ever believes the blind girl Advice If a blind girl says she hears things believe her and dont tell her to shut up I think this is the moral of the story Listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your pointbr br Lastly I thought the best character was the main police officer He was the best actor and character Everyone else besides Castle Freak was pretty run of the mill 310,0
Manipulative drama about a glamorous model Margaux Hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician Chris Sarandon to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by reallife sibling Mariel whose music teacher he is While the central courtroom action holds the attention thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingways lawyer the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musicians side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together What the f she was clearly tied up what resistance could she realistically offer br br The second half of the film involving Sarandons rape of the sister which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE 2002 by occurring in a tunnel is rather contrived Mariels character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately The climax in which Sarandon gets his just desserts with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante is however a crowdpleaser in the style of DEATH WISH 1974 incidentally ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both filmsbr br Its worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both Margauxs career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allens MANHATTAN 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of reallife Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosses STAR 80 1983 With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 chillingly the Hemingway family had a history of suicides notably the sisters grandfather celebrated author Ernest who died of a selfinflicted gunshot wound in 1961,0
I thought the movie was a poor documentary Nothing of substance was discussed It seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new The film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science Most scientists appeared stereotyped and sometimes weird A woman said that her awards didnt matter a whole lot only children that were helped She said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards Playing humble scientist are we I have equations dancing in my head another said I dont see how that explains anything to us It hasnt covered significant effects of science on our culture Politics of science were barely touchedbr br Not a bad flick for a 1014 yearolds Other than that I felt it was boring and unrevealingbr br 410,0

There is a bit of a spoiler below which could ruin the surprise of the ONE unexpected and truly funny scene in this film There is also information about the first film in this seriesbr br I caught this film on DVD which someone gave as a gift to my roommate It came as a set together with the first film in the Blind Dead seriesbr br This movie was certainly much worse than the first La Noche del Terror Ciego In addition many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly To boot the movie was dubbed in English the first was subtitled which I tend to find distractingbr br The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals Upon discovery of these crimes the local peasantry put the Templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used thus preventing them from returning from Hell to exact their revenge We then jump to modern times where because of some event the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place Of course since the undead knights have no eyes they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noisebr br The Templars were a secretive order from about the 12th century coming out of the Crusades They were only around for about 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others Because they were secretive there were always rumors about their ceremonies particularly for initiation Also because of the way the society was organized you didnt necessarily have church officials overseeing things which meant they didnt have an inside man when things heated up And because of the nature of their trials they were tortured into confessions The order was strongest in France but did exist in Portugal and Spain where the movies take placebr br Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here of course this is a horror film after all and then once the knights come back to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood in this sequel this all disappears You still have the same scene redone not the same footage of them sacrificing the virgin but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that Thus when they come back they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience Theres also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake which would date it around 1473 And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well In the first they have them pecked out by crows Now they are simply burned out and in quite a ridiculous mannerbr br Oh yeah and maybe it was just me but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film despite having died Not really a problem since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation but odd nonethelessbr br The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep The childs father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep so he walks out and tells her to find her father It comes somewhat out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the film Of course why the child doesnt die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fansbr br I couldnt possibly recommend this film to anyone It isnt so bad that it becomes funny so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film The bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded When the film ends you are not surprised at the outcome at all in fact quite disappointed If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film see the first movie which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes,0

Daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright Except in this case it doesnt Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas he wrote The Robe and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brabr br Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight To make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it No it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy In between times they fall in lovebr br Try as I might I cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of American mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of Sirks films this one isnt too deep On the plus side Rock Hudson isnt half bad I think I am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in Sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals Nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime TV,0
If you dont mind having your emotions toyed with then you wont mind this movie On the other hand if you enjoy British crime mysteries following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end youll be very disappointedbr br Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment br br While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery the huge truck that stopped and blocked the childrens view just before her disappearance doesnt get caught on camera This is a critical piece of the mystery Its inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mysterybr br The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the childrens movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from cameravisible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing cluesbr br In England driving is on the left The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right several meters away from the flower kiosk when it could have easily parked immediately behind or even on the side as the huge truck didbr br The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime but cant find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfallbr br Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and huntingbr br It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kioskbr br It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential parkbr br The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slowdimwitted justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to selfincriminatebr br There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionados disappointment Five Days is a very weak British crime story,0

Tashan the title itself explains the nature of the moviebr br This type of movies are actually made for flop What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than Cgrade movies Or even some Cgrade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan The much hyped and overconfidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the boxoffice which it certainly deservedbr br In my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films banner How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvis ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiencesbr br The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saifs hand instead of Akshay Just from the starting point I expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth Saif is the main behind the whole adventure while Akshay joins in the midst In any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit And Tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hitbr br Akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again In between Saif did a great job in Race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie But he has fully developed himself in the acting field And last but not the least about Kareena She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean But I myself dont think so instead she became slim Yes slim it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male Beside them it is nice that Saifs son Ibrahim appears in the beginning last as young Saif I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his careerbr br Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directionsbr br Sorry I dont like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies,0

I saw this film yesterday I rented the DVD from Blockbuster In fact I know one of the actresses from the film I wont say who Thats kept under wraps But I must admit it wasnt as good as I thought it would be Tom Savini Hats down to this guy But its a shame he wasnt in the film for long What lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc It may look like a good movie but it wasnt that entertainingbr br Well Im glad my Sister paid 10 for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbuster I chose this one and I was disappointed Anyway thumbs down for me Not my cup of tea 0 out of 10,0
Recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the DVD made me realize that this was a local movie The word Detroit in the title furthered my suspecions and I did some looking up of things and yes a local movie it wasbr br So I picked it up Someone I knew actually knew some of the producersdirector dont remember which and said the producersdirectors got people to PAY to be in this moviebr br Brilliant What a great idea The movie makers get some capital to do the movie with thanks to their cast and crew Then the investors cast crew others get some of the profits Im imaginingbr br Profitsbr br Um anyways This film totally underwhelmed me The special effects were special as in special children who ride the small buses to school The acting was very amusing not intentionally however Theres a great line where a guy says well this bone aint gonna smoke itself as a pickup line Unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film The story Well I sort of followed it about 35 of the way in then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it it suddenly ended I mean as inno resolution of anythinglike they ran out of time Sorry folks out of time goodnightbr br We sat there baffled and booing and threw in another film Then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine showed upwith one of the guys from the movie We threw it back in and he the actor gave us a running commentary which was awesome because he totally ripped on the moviebr br What more could you ask forbr br The most absurd scene for me was a motorbike chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all That and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl In pain The zombies looked less like zombies than my coworkers do And I dont work at the morgue eitherbr br So I recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the funbr br Otherwise give this one a pass Rent something like Feeders if you want a jaw droppingly bad in a funny way movie,0
One hour eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and I decided it was pretty lame That was right after Hopalong Chris Lybbert drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse I was pretty mystified by the whole Hopalong CassidyGreat Bar 20 gimmick which didnt translate into anything at all Obviously the name Coppola in the credits couldnt do anything to guarantee success here even with more than one listedbr br If you make it to the end of the film youll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions I did What exactly was the hook with the gloves Whats up with the rodeo scenario Who was The Stranger supposed to represent Why did they make this film br br I could probably go on but my energys been drained Look theres already a Western called The Gunfighter from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad That one I can recommend,0
Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack But there are legitimate reasons for it 1 Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film BUT he didnt like the script wanted to change it his request was denied so he didnt do the film 2 It was low budget Bill Murray had grown to superstar status Ted Knight passed away in 1986 and Chevy Chase the so called ace of the first movie although it was Rodney all the waycouldntt be on more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him BUT you had Dan Aykroyd Robert Stack Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason all serviceable substitutes who none had their best performances,0

The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin And gross An obese lawyer drives over the Gypsy woman and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight to the bone OK Gypsy curses should be entertaining but the weightlosing gone bad Nope Except Stephen King thinks so And Michael McDowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha The Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how heshe has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness Hey I can only say Well look at the mirror,0
American Pie has gone a long distance from the first At first i believe the actors dont have a clue what their doing and instead its just a remake of a college party gone nuts Story sets out as two freshman college guys featuring the young stifler setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties sex and of course the booze The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie In fact they didnt once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the filmbr br Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking Im a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty wouldve been a better choice instead,0
Revolt of the Zombies has no redeeming features Im tired of people arguing that its not that bad and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 I suspect this isnt true its not like IQs have risen sharply in the last 7 decades The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today Why Just try watching the first scenes and count the pauses between things happening the awful choice of when to cut to closeup the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time Pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue Im going to make some teago outsideread my book now Are you Yes I am That sort of exchange happens several times Normally I would love that being a HUGE fan of bad movies but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away This sort of disinterested potboiling timewaster is far worse than energetic imaginative mindblowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians Those who claim that this is better than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment its bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom Which is far worse,0

The comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate I feel exactly the same way that I am very disappointed at how far Rick Mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on This Hour Has 22 Minutes but now he is just clowning around going places and talking to people He does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines Most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses etc He used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving This Hour Has 22 Minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more Now that Air Farce is off the air finally thank goodness Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes have got to be next in line for the axe just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more Its sad really considering Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian TV,0

This is one of the most ridiculous westerns that Hollywood ever made Gary Cooper plays Reb Hollister a former confederate officer wanted by the law He meets up with a moron named Weatherby played by Leif Erickson who is a US Marshal with no knowledge of firearms Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee Tonia Robles played by Ruth Roman Senor Robles Tonias father has plenty of men but they cant seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brothers Will Marlow played by Raymond Massey has financed the loan on the Robles estate making things completely absurd He even has the power to call for mortgage payments before theyre due simply because he feels like itbr br Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who cant fight since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee Tonia Just another instance of more plot nonsense Are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job Wait a minute this guy couldnt pass the written test either he switches identities with Reb Hollister who of course is an expert gunman Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherbys girl with a passionate kiss while Weatherby looks on like an idiot Gary Cooper Hollywoods number one stud is in fine form here as Reb Before the movies done not only does he take Weatherbys job he steals his fiancee also and Ruth Roman as Tonia falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump Leif Erickson the brushoff before the films little more than half overbr br There isnt a shred of plot credibility in the whole film so despite the good cast and lush photography the film is a dud And Coopers character is a complete heel to boot The film also stars Barbara Payton as Brant Marlows girl a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances unfortunately by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons I strongly suggest you pass this one up,0
This kind of inspirational saccharine is enough to make you sick It telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car I guess youd need such prompting to feel if youre stupid enough to watch a film as simpleminded and sappy as this Streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if its just thata display switched on and off like a light Because I cant for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film Even though its based on a true story and an inspirational one at that Im sure the setup execution and performances play like a thirdrate TV movie or halfwitted high school drama,0
No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a fulltime photographer its a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one While this movie is not without its interesting elements mullets from hell etc it is outweighed by flaws For one thing Angela the murderous counselor appears to be about the same age as the campers Having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film And then you have the murder scenes The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original But overall there are a ton of movies out there that are scariermore fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching,0
This has to be by far the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it I figured it couldnt be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor WRONG No one should waste their time on this film I fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and I dont feel that I missed a thing,0

Okay I really tried to tap into the so called silly surreal humor that this film sets out to be Im told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to America go figure and has less political references Apart from all that I found this sexualpolitical farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn The central female lead is easy on the eyes and could actually act I would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles and nonot the ones youre thinking of Its obvious that Japan can and doesproduce just as much crap as other countries I couldnt recommend this to anyone with the distant possibility of someone who has a Jones for Asian porn Go see a real Japanese film,0
I dont really consider myself a conservative so I wasnt personally offended by this film but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message And the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid or both The characters are onedimensional either good freedomloving Americans or brainless greedy evil conservatives Theres nothing clever or creative just anticonservative I dont really mind the political bias itself but it shouldnt be the only purpose behind the movie And clearly it isbr br On the positive side the cast is wonderful and Chris Coopers impression of W is funny the first two or three times but after that its just the same old joke being told over and over againbr br So if you really hate the conservatives youll probably enjoy this film but if youre looking for something with realistic characters and a story thats less blackandwhite then youd be better off watching something else,0

Skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel Ye Shall Know Them by Vercors To unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance But in spite of its honourable intentions and its wellmeaning tone Skullduggery simply isnt a very good film For me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which cant make its mind up how best to convey its message The first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the Tarzan ilk later it teeters into scifi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics The differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook They stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that youre watching a muddled disorganised moviebr br An archaeological expedition into the jungles of New Guinea is led by adventurer Douglas Temple Burt Reynolds One of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist Dr Sybil Greame Susan Clark After an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange apelike creatures These primitive longlost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man There is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans Or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual Or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics The archaeologists call the tribe the Tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery But things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen Paul Hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers He questions whether the Tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continuedbr br This was a very early film in Reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like hes in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously Not that Reynolds can be blamed he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick His character and the film are not relevant to each other Clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for British actors Edward Fox Alexander Knox and Wilfrid HydeWhite A major shortcoming in Skullduggery is the lame and ineffective makeup used to give the Tropi their strange hairy appearance Rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuckon hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and thats just not the right idea Were meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but thats awfully hard when they look so unconvincing Skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating The honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesnt do them justice A worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless,0
Why is it that in the 50s and 60s Italians made so of the best movies and then during the 70s and 80s made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies Probably because art films didnt make any money The Cannibal Movie unlike the Zombie Movie which was created by Americans and exploited by Italians is a purely Italian creation designed as a mondo exploitation showcase and to make as much money as possible no artistic integrity getting in the way here Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday The director Umberto Lenzi hadnt even hit his stride yet his genre classic Cannibal Ferox was still a year awaybr br In plotting similar to read ripped off from Ruggero Deodatos seminal cannibal classic Cannibal Holocaust a woman Janet Agren receives word from the police that theyve received a 8mm film from her sister Shes gone missing in Africa and its suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it Mel Ferrer as a Professor of Somethingoranother tells her that a man named Jonas Ivan Rassimov has started a Jonestownlike cult in New Guinea and thats where the sister is The woman hires a guide Robert Kerman to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister And wouldnt you know it the jungle is full of cannibals br br One sentence should sum it up if youve seen on Cannibal Movie youve seen them all mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other Lenzi copied Cannibal Holocaust to make this film and retooled this to make Cannibal Ferox Deodato copied parts of this for Hit and Run And because they all share the same material they all feature the same traits awful photography boring scenery terrible dubbing overacting and exploitation exploitation exploitation Genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran Rassimov and Kerman have a scenery eating contest Agren exists solely to be naked raped or in peril Plenty o gore for all the sickos out there The cannibals who do actually appear to be native cannibals eat lunch met disguised as human flesh And in the grand tradition of Cannibal Movies any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter Overall really not a good experience but Im sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining I know I did,0
I just caught Wild Rebels on one of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 archive compilations and this movie was so bad even the MST3K crew couldnt make it entertaining There are some MST3K targets that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldnt possibly have been good movies like The Green Slime and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadnt bobbled them in the execution Wild Rebels is a film whose basic premise DID make a good movie three years earlier when Don Siegel directed his remake of The Killers at Universal Both films are about a failed racing driver whos seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the womans boyfriend only in The Killers the driver was John Cassavetes the woman was Angie Dickinson and the criminal mastermind cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film was Ronald Reagan Steve Alaimo Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are quite a comedown But what REALLY makes Wild Rebels an awful movie is the direction by William Grefé note the accent over the final e present in his onscreen credit which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point Its only a pity that someone didnt do a mocking commentary on this movie now in 2009 the comparison between Steve Alaimos hairdo and Rod Blagojevichs would have been irresistible,0

What we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80s incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash cinema completely speechless Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a very cheap and cheesy fantasySwordandSorcery adventure that doesnt have an actual plot but does eagerly shamelessly borrows elements from other films Writer Ed Naha and Hector Olivera who watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically In order to make a fantasyadventure you need one super evil villain preferably with a black cape one young hero in training one lone warrior one amiable type of furry pet one wise midget living in the woods optional and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons enslaved dwarfs and winged gargoyles to serve as filler The story is phenomenal and so original with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka takes over the power and killed the king Simon wants to go back and save the people but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape Simon befriends lone warrior Kor the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check who assists Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals dangerous encounters and magical showdowns Admittedly it doesnt even sound too bad thus far but thats merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little details Simon has a best friend named Gulfax for example Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodlesnout to yelp something incomprehensible The obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content Simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph Kor settles an old score with the pigfaced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and theres the supposedly horrible suicide cave where you can only sing your way out of But the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors Simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors hoping they will assist them in their battle but the rotting corpses only take a few steps complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves Thats it So much for the zombie sub plot Best sequence ever I could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs but you get the idea Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a tremendously messedup sobaditsgood film Word of advice do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone Invite friends preferably the dopeheaded types with a wicked sense of humor and watch it in group It will be a night to remember,0
First of all this is one of the worst softcore straight to cable erotic thriller Ive ever seen in my life Of course like all erotic thrillers are want to do its about a brothel madam and is set in a brothel This of course makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem in context Whateverbr br Forget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards The actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe The woman who plays the female cop is so bad its beyond description She must be a really REALLY good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure if you know what I meanbr br The production values are only slightly higher than porn Other than that I suppose if youre really drunk and you need something to laugh at this would be a perfect film And if thats the case I recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the female cop Whats that accent Brooklyn Hilarious,0

If it werent for the editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger it would be easy to mistake this lowbudget snoozer for a SciFi channel pilot The plot about the governments attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero himself gifted in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge Alas the movie is talky boring predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects Topbilled Louis Gossett Jr has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces He walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered Other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little,0

First lets get it out of the way yeah this film steals a LOT from Darkness Falls 2003 The plot for Darkness Falls goes something like this The Tooth Fairy a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge In The Tooth Fairy 2006 the disfigured Tooth Fairy who yeah hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone A little too similar to be coincidencebr br But what must be asked is this If youre going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie why choose something as mediocre as Darkness Falls Sure it made a few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered A lowbudget straighttovideo movie will not have that same effect And it didntbr br As I watched the opening 1520 minutes of the film my expectations actually rose There seemed to be at least SOME production value The story didnt seem terrible just blatantly ripped off Past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an exdoctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a Busey and some hot veterinary student Jenifer from Argentos Masters of Horror Jenifer After those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain It serves all the basic horrible clichés including but not limited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heartofgoldbr br One of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience Its kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time When the adults were on screen it had a more mature feel When Star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to a more stupid err immature level When the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark only less scarybr br Technically the film is all over the place The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring The writing is subpar as is the acting for the most part On the plus side theres some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene Also if youre looking for a bit of the sexy stuff theres a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that Other than that theres not much to bother with when it comes to this filmbr br If youre a huge fan of Darkness Falls do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way but thats about the only reason I can find to see this onebr br Final Verdict 310 AP3,0

What a terrible movie It represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of French society where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared The plot is nonsensical the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting To say the least the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired Catherine Deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour The rest of the usually good cast Vincent Lindon Line Renaud Jean Yanne seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity platitudes and restlessness I cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful James Ivorys Le Divorce with its thoughtful depiction of French and American mores its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use Having watched Le Divorce you can feel a kind of empathy with the French regardless of their foibles BelleMaman leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists,0
This films kind of like Conan the Barabarian but with more sex rape and murder There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers dont do a good job showing it which is a shame because it could be a decent story Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didnt appear in anything else of note The fight scenes arent too bad either I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims and theres plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br All in all not good but not necessarily that bad either,0
The film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway It was a reworking of Trespass Walter Hill and so The Treasure Of the Sierra Madre with less tension bite and human emotion There was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for This movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies For an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill Better than watching snow fall but not for me,0

This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seenbr br I cant believe that the writer and director didnt see that almost all the movie looks like a SF onebr br For example br br 1 It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quicklybr br 2 You cant get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the moviebelieve me its my domainbr br 3 With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy Lets say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from ironbr br 4 If you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint in the best case its more likely to die because your hart fails before to get to the boneshinbr br And there are more other examples,0
I saw this movie partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix and from it I leaned a valuable lesson Not a lesson about ethnic diversity howeverthe lesson I learned is Dont trust reviewsbr br Yes racism sucks and people are complicated but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that its being reviewed by people who arent used to thinking or whove seen their first thoughtprovoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept In fact he basically made this film which should be called Racism For Dummies as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who dont spend a lot of time thinking the impression that theyve discovered some fundamental truth thats never been covered in a film before Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence its not An afterschool special for the unthinking masses cut into bitesized overwrought hamfisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspectionbr br Its as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that were such good people because we dont identify with the characters Lets face it people NOBODY identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes Its well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you dont think to ask wheres the beef until you can tell the film is winding down The flaming car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end br br The messages are very heavyhanded and from the behind the scenes blurb the producers were clearly watching a different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment more like a high school diversity lessoncall it the Blood on the Highway of racism They could even show this in high schools if it werent for the sidenude shot of Jennifer Espositobr br In this film everyones a jerk and everyone learns a lesson except for Michael Pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storylinebr br This is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayonsbr br Crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things,0
My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared so I assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual guidelinesbr br I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as Blow and The Alamo Leonor Watling is also quite good Unfortunately everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful melodramatic script There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of artbr br An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere anytime,0
I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie It has set the standard I will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as horrible as this one I fully agree with the other comments about this film But since Im Dutch I watched it with Dutch translation Apparently they didnt have money for a proper translation so they decided to babelfish it With sometimes hilarious resultsbr br Dont smoke dont drink dont do drugs dont watch Demon Summerbr br I was surprised that the actors Wow I cant believe I just said that didnt hold the script Was there any in their hands while shooting I think they also did a good job on Well Uhmm No they didnt do a good job at all,0
OkayI had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see thisI thoughtI have no idea of what this movie was likeso I went ahead and put it inOH MY GODThis film is so darn badI never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it didbut I did laughbecause all the jokes were so corny and ridiculousnot funnySo much stuff in this movie was funnybecause it was SO STUPIDThis film is not anywhere near goodI would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if youve already seen ittrust meI feel your pain as well,0
Yeah that about sums it up This movie was horrifying Two minutes in I wanted to gouge my eyes out This has been praised as an innovative LDS comedy but its not even good for members of that church I dont think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low qualitybr br First of all you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie It seems as if the horribly drab glib trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent at least semicoherent thought Then theres the acting which is dismal from everybody involved Even the cameos fail to liven anything upbr br And lets not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue appallingly hideous gags and a lot of Mormon injokes that anyone in their right mind LDS or not should consider purely stupid This has to be one of the worst films Ive ever seen,0
Infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and I have yet to come across a worse offender than Wes Cravens The Hills Have Eyes Having held back from watching this for years I was really pleased when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying I neednt have botheredbr br After a promising if familiar start that firmly sets the film in the Desolution USA world of survival horror things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wastelandbr br Looking like it was shot on a budget of 5 with the cannibal clans costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and Red Indian attire the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic WASPs who take a detour on a road trip to California to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone When they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesheaters and have to fight to survivebr br While hoping for another Deliverance Texas Chainsaw Massacre Wrong Turn or Devils Rejects I actually realised Id stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video stores bargain binbr br With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound closeups I can kind of see how an 18 Certificate in the UK is justified but with those closeups trimmed this wouldnt have looked out of place as a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITVbr br The whole silver minenuclear test site subplot is just a McGuffin to justify pitching the civilised family against the primitives but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passersbybr br And then theres the ending or lack thereof The Hills Have Eyes seems to be missing either a third act or at the very least a satisfying denouement Instead I was just left wondering Yeah and,0
Let me say at the outset that Im not a very artistic person and that I dont get new art That being said this film is absolutely crazy and in my opinion not crazy in a good way Filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories Avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say wow I feel the energy and passion of this painting The only reason I give this film a 3 out of 10 is because I actually did manage to laugh at some parts though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film Two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn as to do what these characters were doing I have no idea I wouldnt recommend this film to anybody,0
This is another SciFi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse the acting or the writingdirectingproducing John Sheppherd helms all threeBasic story obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monstersmuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter handsome hero and mad scientist Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship since of course wouldnt believe a monster storyNo dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here Budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seals to arrive in a fiberglass fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard Puleeze Also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer I also loved when the Seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship If the SciFi channel is going to continue original movies I hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors If this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin,0
Children love dinosaurs Its somewhat part of their culture But theyve got The Land Before Time The original At least that movie had heart This This movie is just plain pathetic Just because kids love dinosaurs doesnt mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children This movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and its more by the numbers stuff Not as soul sucking as Theodore Rex but its lightyears away from being a Land Before Time,0
Last week I watched a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Macbeth It was 25 years old filmed wno props except swords no furniture except chairs It was RIVETING The acting was super all the actors trained Brits Contrast that performance to thisyawn yawn yawn Al Pacino as Shylock was tragic heavy and couldnt quite lose the New Yorker accent despite the longpausesbetweenlines The whole thing was soporific even the comic scenes were barely even worth a smile let a lone a belly laugh This is supposed to be funny They tried to make it tragic It was neither just boring I give it four points for costumes scenery and Jeremy Irons who is good at playing a dull depressed deepvoiced guy can he be anything else,0
Watching this I mainly noticed the ad placements DHL Aquawhite Strips Rockstar and more Its one product placement after another Its quite obvious how this movie got its funding Jessica Simpsons acting is laughable Any Dick shouldnt ever get work because he plays the same lame character The story is just a backdrop for this very long commercial I cant believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release The longer you watch this movie the more youre embarrassed for everyone involved The only minor saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook who gets almost no screen time as Jessicas cousin Im embarrassed I watched the whole thing I would recommend avoiding this one,0

Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chans Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx and what do you get You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoolike madnessbr br The limited plot has Magoo Leslie Nielsen put into an international plot where he steals a worldrenowned gem Of course he has no idea what he is doing In fact he has no idea that he had the gembr br Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken You will wish that you were as nearsighted as Magoo Its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster You have to love Leslie Nielson because he was made some very funny movies This isnt his best but he does a good job playing Magoo I thought it was a funny film and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny,0
I bought this film on DVD despite the stale review and that was idiotic That review was completely accurate and I have never seen any worse erotic film in my long life Even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings plus a nice cover But my own Extreme Erotica c films are over 100 times more erotic just in the soft delicious aspect with probably less than 100 times of this films budget The story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book Or any new exciting element of slave training except some very strange and sad developments Then did the main male character Klaus Kinski not look a bit like the second Master of O he try to play And not even lovely Arielle Dombasle did look delicious in any scene,0
The name Frau of the main character is the German word for Woman I dont know if that was intentional or not but if sure got some giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year when it was shownbr br But those were the only giggles the movie got Not that it was aiming for giggles its a horrible movie for heavens sake A horrible movie in more than one meaning Its a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer definetely not for the faint of Heart And it wasnt even necessary to show all the things that are shown Im not even going into a moral obligation because movies dont really have that kind of task or function discussion of what is shown here but this is a new low on the whole torture movement that has grown in the last few years,0
Ah the classic genre of 80s sex comedies This is set on two beaches one a nude beach featuring myriad fully unclothed women The plot Something about a bunch of dimwits attempting to get laid The usual Fans of gratuitous TA and P should hunt this one down,0
Yes said title line does actually appear in this movie Why Im not sure When the line was actually being said didnt somebody in the crew filming at some point laugh I would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie mostly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itselfbr br Helmed by director Jim Gillespie I Know What You Did Last Summer comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we havent ever seen a teen slasher movie before Of course hes not to be given all the blame There are also three writers responsible and this is somehow based on a video game thats still in production The title of said game is Backwater but upon looking for information on it I came up with absolutely nothingbr br And so we begin the movie I would like to say before I continue that I wasnt expecting this to win an Oscar When I am in the right mindset I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time I think there exists an opportunity for an effective original and smart slasher movie Venom is not this moviebr br There is almost no character development at all Thats fine You dont expect a whole lot However instead of a wellknit cast of a few this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie cliché charactersbr br 1 The Final Girl She has just broken up for her boyfriend This means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril they will decide to get back together again Which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie Eden is played by Agnes Bruckner without much enthusiasm I might addbr br 2 The Boyfriend Hes just around to coexist with The Final Girl until his demise Sure he can save her but hes doomed and we know it Eric is played by Jonathan Jacksonbr br 3 The Bimbos Usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these but here we have two They shoplift they steal they might show their breasts not in this case or they might possibly be alcoholics A staple of the genre They also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome usually saying things like Hello Is there anybody there Tammy and Patty suitably named are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwoodbr br 4 The Jackass Sure he looks pretty but hes the idiot in the movie thats inserted purely to be an idiot He says stupid things does stupid things has obviously never seen a horror movie and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for Sean is played by DJ Cotronabr br 5 The Girlfriend She loves the Jackass even though pretty much nobody else does and shes usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind Rachel is played by Laura Ramseybr br 6 The Creepy Janitor In this case The Creepy Gas Station Attendant Enough said Ray is played by Rick Cramerbr br I could continue but I think you get the picture The remaining characters arent so much common as they are equally killable Theres The Gay Guy Pawel Szajda as Ricky who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned and The One Who Knows Whats Going On Of course none of that matters because at first everyone always thinks that ones crazy Cece is played by Meagan Goodbr br There are a couple other characters namely a deputy played by Method Man but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clichésbr br So youre probably thinking why does this movie require such a deep analysis Its just a summer horror flick for cryin out loud Based on that question does it deliver the goods Yes and no The acting isnt particularly convincing even given the amount of talent involved Bijou Phillips was hailed for her performance in Larry Clarks Bully and Agnes Bruckner has been an upandcoming talent for a while nowbr br So what about the gore Theres some Thats really about it A lot of the juiciest bits are cutaways Namely a scene involving somebodys face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from carsbr br To the filmmakers credit there are a couple interesting scenes I liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the charactersbr br If this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didnt make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them it might have made for a more enjoyable experience All of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a notparticularlyinteresting countdown until we know its just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girlbr br I suppose I must be a little jaded but as a horror film fan Im left wondering why I should have bothered when I could easily have written a better screenplay myself I wont even mention the numerous instances of terrible CGI,0
The script was VERY weak wo enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you dont have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue On a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times Then again this could be called a blessing Overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes The obvious in your face homages to Sam Raimi and Evil Dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off Cmon this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done Still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed,0
Pathetic worse than a bad madeforTV movie I cant believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick For some reason Morgan Freemans character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to NSync boys girlfriend Morgan Freeman calling women pussy is just awkward What the hell were the people behind this film thinking Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearablebr br I rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked,0
Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind the successful Greek Gialloesquire thriller Death Kiss in 1974 and yet when you combine the three talents all you get is this complete load of drivel God only knows what drove the likes of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick but I really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes The story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids leading another group to go after them The pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring The plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this and no doubt done much better The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesnt manage to overcome this at any point This really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel Extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended,0
Please dont waste your time This movie rehashes the worst of Bram Stokers Dracula Van Helsing Anne Rices Vampire Lestat rock music and silly biblical references and Blade hightech toys I really like vampire movies and novels and there are many out there that are very good But not this stinker Not even the soundtrack helps it mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the kickass metal some reported Only a few times did I hear any metal mostly it was tortured violins Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes,0
I have seen already fantastic stories but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him Even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among say souls maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son There is no shade of suspense or thrill just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in lifebr br This is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality actually first time director Joby Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen at his first major role after having taken off the Anakin Skywalker costume fabulous Jessica Alba and supergifted Lena Olin All would have deserved a better story,0
Thats pretty ridiculous I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the US Uk and all over the world The religion has over a billion followers I Myself born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society I am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world I have know many Muslims from all over and I have traveled to countries like PakistanI have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the mediaI wonder why Also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion Its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent I am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK IRA and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion,0
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired Toshiharu Ikeda who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film EVIL DEAD TRAP shows little enthusiasm for the stale premisebr br A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot Predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensuesbr br The staple of roman porno is sex And sex mixed with violence Both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh A masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to latebr br The series rain motif continues and the films final scene brings relief,0
This review is based on the English language versionbr br Orson Welles legendary unfinished epic was just that unfinished It should have been left as such not thrown together in this clumsy boring compilation of whatever material was availablebr br While Im sure it was done with the best of intentions the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to Welles vision theyve also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version upon audiencesbr br The first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio Not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances theyre also inconsistent Welles original recordings using his own voice as he often did have been retained in a handful of scenes they dont match at all There hasnt been the slightest attempt at consistency Add to that an extremely empty sound mix which has only a bare minimum of sound effects atmos a long sequence during a huge festival including the running of the bulls sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd thats meant to be in the thousandsbr br However the real problem is the unavoidable fact that Don Quixote was incomplete its glaringly obvious from watching this The film consists of a handful of scenes strung together dragged out to ridiculous lengths just to make up the running time Case in point the sequence where Sancho searches for Don Quixote in the city goes on forever Its just Sancho approaching people in the crowd asking them the same questions over over again there is no way that Welles could ever have intended using every single take in its entirety but thats what appears here It lasts over twelve minutes when in fact it would most likely have lasted about two minutes absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film br br While the start of the film is relatively complete rather well done the rest has massive holes which simply cant be filled with endless overlay of Spanish countryside still more shots of Don Quixote Sancho going back forth Theres also no ending No resolution no conclusion no punchline no pointbr br Although there is material in private collections that was unavailable to the filmmakers that couldnt possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete coherent work Welles simply didnt complete shooting largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finishbr br However putting aside the fact that it wasnt complete never could be one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough Unfortunately by putting it all together in such a slipshod manner one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall In particular what was clearly a terrific performance from Akim Tamiroff as Sancho is utterly ruined with the new voice with long drawn out scenes that eventually cause him to be simply irritatingbr br Orson Welles vision for this film was something far more ambitious complex than a simple retelling of the story of Don Quixote but thats what has been attempted here as such the point is lost The only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been Welles himself he didntbr br The footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary chronicling the whole saga of Welles trying to make the film Welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a doco When Are You Going To Finish Don Quixote,0
What an awful adaptation The worst part was the music Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800s The only character that didnt bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and I love Jane Austen movies usually I didnt even rent it I borrowed it from the library They should have paid me to take it I dont quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another Isabella and her brother were way overdone it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isnt This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies Ive seen,0
This movie suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no clue as to how to package Jackie Chan for the masses His lowbudget Hong Kong movies were all fastpaced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy His early Hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris There is nothing about Chans character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian except for his being the star In his Hong Kong films Chan is never dull with the movies being one rapidfire martial arts sequence after another but The Protector is lifeless throughout Danny Aiello isnt given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together Both have been better in worse movies The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings The worst part is the appalling way that Jackie Chan comes off so colorless and drab It wouldnt be until the madeinCanada Rumble in the Bronx that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie,0
The premise sucked me in but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either David Lynch or something seriously terrible Interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list I can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece Romero comes to mind but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one The message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 or simply get a lobotomy Jennifer what happened to ya and blindly follow the Bible without any sort of selfexamination whatsoever or well trigger the second coming Its the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC I like to think that God is a little greater than that,0
There was some good build up of suspense throughout The cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget We witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you Silence would have been golden here There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother Something tells me theres a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc You decide Throughout the film I cant seem to find a connection or for that matter sympathy with the characters perhaps thats because they dont develop one throughout the film character that is There are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters overshadowed again by some questionable scenes In one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger A definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic,0
Super Troopers was an instant classic Club Dread while disappointing to many had its moments Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the Broken Lizard group who made Super Troopers so naturally I picked it up I only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny A far cry from Super Troopers All in all I was very disappointed I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time However youre better off playing video games or watching something that might make you laugh or think,0
Yes this review may contain spoilers but youll thank me for it This is the worst film Ive seen in quite some time I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and Spaceys performance in particularbr br Some will chastise me for saying it but I find Kevin Spaceys acting quite limited despite the worlds admiration for him I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevins American Beauty role His character in this film is ridiculously overacted all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistantbr br There are allworld trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low Somehow I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button this is approximately 20 minutes into the filmbr br What about the fauxhomage to Resevoir Dogs Whaley proclaims I think I saw this in a movie once as if hes going to cut off Spaceys ear But what does he use to cut him An envelope Thats right hes going to give him paper cuts That has to be one of Hollywoods alltime worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appallingbr br I will admit that I didnt see the end of this film my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense Well I dont care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly overthetop dialogue I even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did,0
The movies storyline is pat and quaint Two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves Unfortunately if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central Asia this is absolutely terriblebr br The producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it To begin with and most glaringly incorrect the Nuristanis as they were known in the thirties and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by AbdulRahman Shah of Aghnaistan were not nomads In fact they have not been nomads since the Aryan invasions of central Asia over three milenia agobr br Second the city that is filmed as Tehran is not Tehran which is understandable however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly DIFFERENT than the city of Tehran which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range which predominates all of the cities viewsbr br Third Persian despite the fact it is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan is never heard in movie When there are native speakers who do not speak in German they speak in Arabic The Persian guards at the border in fact say to each other Ma hadha rujal This is not a man and not in mard nist as it would be in Persian Also the love song between the Indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in Spanish While talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the Quran uses the words Ferdos and jehaan and makes some reference to drugs afterwords These words certainly never appear in the Quran as they are Persian for Paradise indeed Ferdos and Paradise are very distant cognates between our languages and World respectively though Jehaan is admittedly close to Jehennan which is hell in Arabic When they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also Arabic this despite the fact that there are NO native speakers of Arabic in Iran and Afghanistan and its use is primarily religious with some use in education at that timebr br When they are stopped in Iran before they reach the Afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any Iranian group Their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile In Iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear Turbans unless they are a cleric The language spoken is clearly Arabic from the initial greeting of Ahlan wa Sahlan When they do reach Kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the Hindu Kush mountain range There is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring The area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name The Indian Killers because of its difficult and limiting groundbr br In short the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place It lacks any real draw to it being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to Nuristan however even that is stillborn and no real development is felt leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose In short this is a really bad movie that I would have rated at one star except for the good footage of Bedouin and the deserts of the Levant even if they are misnamed,0
The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance what a laughable title its so utterly misleading Its not surprising that the filmmakers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible moviebr br The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote islandbr br Very little happens in this film And when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voiceartists These guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remediallevel morons It really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal But the voiceartists cannot be blamed for the script Its a travesty Unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst The story in general is to say the least uneven The women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tediousbr br The whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience It doesnt remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen All we get is a few halfhearted severed head shotsbr br A few people have said that this movie is a giallo I cannot agree less with this opinion Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it Its basically a softcore porn film with a horror angle But its not very erotic eitherbr br I cant recommend this to anyone,0
Man I really wanted to like these shows I am starving for some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these opportunites But sadly I am in the minority I guess when it comes to the Cinematic Stephen King As brilliant as Kings writing is the irony is that it simply doesnt translate well to the screen big or small With few exceptions very few the King experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read Many people would disagree with this but Im sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read The reason is simple The average King story takes place in the mindscape of the characters in the story He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view In short King takes the reader places where you cant put a Panavision camera As an audience watching the filmed King were left with less than half the information than the reader has access to Its not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed For as long as King writes Hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor without any regard to whether or not they should I dont blame the filmmakers for trying but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works The task is akin to turning lead into gold or some arcane Zen mastery Oh well better luck next time,0

JESSICA A GHOST STORY is as the name implies a ghost story The theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedybr br A woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead This constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot There is really nothing more to it The movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her deathbr br Immediately from the opening scenes this movie has the appearance of a straighttoDVD effort Unlike gems such as VACANCY 2 the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives straighttoDVD movies a bad name The direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense scares or tension Even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduringbr br The acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting careerbr br Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges Im not exaggeratingbr br The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs I stress the word few in that sentence This is not overall one of the sobaditsgood movies like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE If you want to laugh hysterically watch those movies If you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE THE CHANGELING RINGU THE EYE original Korean version THE GRUDGE ONE MISSED CALL or PHONEbr br I advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing JESSICA A GHOST STORY to keep up the good work Just forget this movie exists Dont spare a thought for it,0
I found the documentary entitled Fast Cheap and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary The documentary contained four mini documentaries about four interesting men Each one of these men was extremely involved with his job showing sheer love and enjoyment for ones jobbr br The sad part I must say would have to be the subjects in which these individuals workedstudied They were interesting for about five minutes afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too longbr br The video was filmed in a very creative way though I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music,0
I got encouraged to watch this film because Ive heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone disturbing shocking all that jazz Well I am disturbed because I spent money on it and I am shocked that something so Godawful actually got released Thats about itbr br This is a supposed new look at Charles Mansons family of insane loser junkies and their murders But if this is a new look then its probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me a headache and I had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to bebr br I suppose I should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that I barely remember if there even WAS a plot at all There was something about a Manson tape delivered to a radio DJ or a TV producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in 69 then the Polanski murders looking like a bad school play and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley I kid you not and then it ended thank God Dont ask me to make any sense of that Im just recalling what I saw The performances were terrible too And how difficult is it to make a convincing Manson Get a short skinny scrawny bloke put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him Theres your Manson But this Manson doesnt even look right He just looks like uh a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on Santa beard painted blackbr br Or maybe thats what this film is actually about Mansons family didnt make any sense so this film doesnt make any sense either Its symbolic Yeah right Im still so angry at spending money on this I stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage Stay away from it its not even worth rentingbr br PS The recent US TV production Helter Skelter got bad reviews here but I saw it last month I saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to Manson Family that new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS And I was disappointed in it Thats how bad Manson Family is it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing TV movie look perfect,0
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing well actually the soundtrack shows that the best i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isnt actually that hard acting well if i saw any i would gladly let you know the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep i will give the person one 1010 and that was for the DVD cover because if i actually saw before watching this in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i wouldnt ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is wow if this was the best i wouldnt want to know what the crap in the film festival was likebr br films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there,0
My mother worked with Dennis L Raider for eleven years not to mention shared an office with him When it was announced he was BTK she was shocked The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer Ive heard her retell them many times Ive inquired her about a lot of things and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to Ive read the entire book written about Raider Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansasbr br There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis killings maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motivesbr br Im going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie This is based on my moms portrayal of him all my readings on him and the video tapes Ive seen of him talkingbr br First of all the camera angles were horrible It looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera The acting was terrible and I couldnt even bear to watch itbr br Dennis Raider never had long hair Dennis Raider was a very anal man and was a follow the rule book kind of guy He wasnt as nice as the movie made him look he was very polite and abrupt business like Same goes for his killings as far as we all know If youve seen his confession in court you can already guessbr br And as for the obsession with the slaughter house No Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs In fact he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods Yet throughout the whole movie he was putting animals in his victims faces and acting like he cared about the wellbeing of thembr br Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew he confessed this but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her alsobr br I really dont even want to go in to this movie and Im already ranting This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie If you want a badly shot halfporno with some slaughter scenes served the side then this is your kind of movie,0
If you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece How could it be worse more you ask Wellat least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra Other than updated graphics modern day themes such as terrorists modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene line in the story was going And for anyone that didnt see the first onewell consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again,0
Haunted Boat sells itself as The Fog meets Open Water In many ways this is accurate There are scares and weird looking people to keep you interestedbr br However the acting ability is poor at best Showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability When you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks onbr br Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange But it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused In terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well Ignoring the irrelevant twisting every 5 seconds near the end you actually want to know what is going on And are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climaxbr br This is no Ghost Ship but itll definitely do for an evening in front of the TV,0
I rented this type of soft core before but I can honestly say I wasnt expecting this to be in the same type as Rod Steele You Only Live Until You Diewhich was both sexy AND funny It had a good script a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose It also has Gabriella Hall who is hot The reason why I didnt expect this movie was because the box was missing the Must be 18 to Rent Sticker I was looking for more cheese and less cheesecakebr br First of all I think movies shouldnt be allowed to start with actors rehearsing for a part at a talent agency or wherever actors rehearse In this movies seeing the actors rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the moviebr br Okay having found out that this WAS a soft core movie I didnt necessarily turn it off and demand my money back But the dizzying way the extended video erotic scenes are added to what was probably a late night paycable release are very annoying and easy to fastforward through without the sustained quality of say Rod Steele You know they mustve had some money because I think some of it is filmed overseasbr br I will have to say the main actor trying NOT to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs Ive ever seen And Ive seen Torgo from Manos It may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee that and Gabriella Hall Still there are better corny movies to rent with your friends,0
I watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny But you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced They make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art This is funny at times but annoying for the most part And to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted One of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit Apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid Very impressive But this is just one example And for what its worth the music sucks the acting sucks the two cute girls are annoying the obnoxious guy is annoying the socalled handsome lead man is a geek and the black girl who fall for him is a fool Her father is the worst actor I have ever seen I am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience,0
I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie But I had no Idea what I was getting myself intobr br I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torturebr br I finally know what hell is like Its this movie For eternity This movie has no value It didnt even really have a plot There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happensbr br Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this moviebr br Dont even watch it Not even to see how bad it is I beg you If you watch it then it means they win,0
After we counted the use of the f word oh about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together well we turned it off Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie the product of unimaginative and notalent writers br br We did give it a second chance thinking surely it would get better No dice Later my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved still no dicebr br The main character did have a cool bikebr br I wouldnt recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents or frat boys,0
A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given 1 million provided he or she makes it that far A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers If there was any hesitation that white people cant dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin Pay close attention for the nipple slip This continues on for about fortyfive minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess Its a game until its not a game The three old coots are in complete control until theyre not The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props Theyre dead until theyre not Even the narrator at the end replies that he doesnt know what the hell happened I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckeys I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself Lets see Gone With the Wind do that This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me Bane Get it Like Rebane I hate myself,0

Remember the wooden undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst You will when you see this broadly acted unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolatebox adaptation Most culpable of all is Catherine ZJ who while undeniably easy on the eye substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance Played pofaced like a melodrama or Cold Comfort Farm without the jokes this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novels sense of irony or tragedy A shame given the quality of the acting talent on offer Joan Plowright Claire Skinner Steven Macintosh all deserve better than this,0
Obviously the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone whos on the crew I dont recall ever seeing a movie thats more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching In my 30 years of watching movies this is the only one I have ever walked out of Bad humor bad jokes bad gags bad editing bad plot etc br br Note to producer Its never funny to hunt humans based on race Great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races but youre still hunting humans based on race and thats sickening,0
Oh how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since DW Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as the yellow man characters so unimaginative and unengaging that its difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this filmbr br Prizzis Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute postmodern disaster in every which way possible The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character Prizzis Honor is a film that falls into a genre of neonoir comedy romance action gangster and overall crime this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story some sort of a sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at allbr br Ill give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is Firstly the film thinks its a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of MY time Charley Partanna Nicholson is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest more than an international hitman He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker Turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out it appears all is not right I read that the plot for this film is A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other Well yes thats true but that actual revelation doesnt happen until about twenty minutes to the end Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of 60 he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is a hardbodied best of the best international hitmanbr br So with a main character who is unlikable and unrealistic we move to the script The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions Partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again Do I marry her Do I love her What is love What do I do and it gets so repetitive its not even able to act as good humour This twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called Maerose Prizzi Huston played by director Johns daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it that got me thinking was this supposed to be funny Should I be laughing The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding alá The Godfather and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters police men and assassins were introduced into the film But what we get is something very very differentbr br The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot right the love and romance is dealt with maybe the film will kickstart I was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs the scene isnt even edited correctly Some suspense some drama Do I shoot or dont I maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before its too late anything but how it was actually executed Prizzis Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax Its a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and dead chauffeurs blink when nudged Prizzis Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any filmgoer and dont say it was a comedy because I didnt laugh

The original movie dated 19did not show any monster it just SUGGESTED scary things br br This version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects br br The mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened By showing the face of the old man this Mister has completely disappeared Even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous This is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original,0
Hero and the Terror is a fairly dull thriller a la no real character substance predictable plot and Boring For a thriller I found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax as it just seemed to drag along until Chucks wifes baby is born and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end which I can hardly remember already even though I only saw the film 10 minutes agobr br I give this film 3 out of 10 for the first 1020 minutes,0
There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this film The original said it all and still holds up Either read the book or do some research about the story and youll realize this remake is ludicrous Eric Roberts as Perry Smith His sister could have done a better job Having been to Holcomb Edgerton KS where the story takes place the sets and locations looked NOTHING like Kansas The original is riveting from the location filming to the use of the actual participants weapons and victims belongings Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad HallThe original is available on DVD in widescreen now Let this turkey die a quick death,0
As far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50s There were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus The acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible Several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were nonexistent The attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings I also couldnt help but think the budget didnt allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon Honestlyit would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie It wasnt bad enough to be a goodbad movie but wasnt good enough to be good either Get the MST3K versionits more fun,0
I must say that I am fairly disappointed by this horror movie I did not get scared even once while watching it It also is not very suspenseful either I was able to guess the ending half way through the movie So whats leftbr br The Ring is a trully scary movie I wish other movies would stop copying from it eg the trademark long hair Please give me some originalitybr br Will not recommend this movie,0
This could have been a good biopic but what a mess I had this film when I was a theater manager When I put the film together and watched it I thought I had some reels out of order As it turned out I didnt and if I did nobody would have noticed I couldnt figure out whats going on Everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way,0
The White Warrior is definitely one ofif not Steve Reeves weakest films Set in 18th or 19th century Russia Steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to over run a mad man Russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking Russian white tunic For the most part the great Reeves physique is hidden in a goofy knee length tunic with an even more sillier looking russian hatbr br The action is rather minimal with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great Reeves physique This is an apparent attempt by the producers to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era with poor results The dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene I would image Reeves regretted making this film but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as Morgan the Pirate and the Thief of Baghdad,0
If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film its theme was literally drowned out by the emphasis on special effects over characterization Almost as if in an attempt to keep up with the rest of the summer action blockbusters Disney has ditched the characterdriven moviewithamessage approach in favor of a Star Wars shootemup with stereotype heroes and villainsbr br The art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images CGI of flying fishcraft and submarines to fill the gap They are wrong and the days of beautiful handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assemblyline CGIbr br This movie is all spectacle with no heart At times the film comes close to being a good worthwhile movie but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitzbr br Another problem with the movie is the pacing It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch voiced well by Michael J Fox and is left thinking Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff thats going to happen once we get to Atlantis Unfortunately not much happens The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the storytellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary islandcontinent They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is even in a fictional story Is it in the Atlantic Is it in the Mediterranean Sea Who knows Nothing is hypothesized even from a purely fantasybased point of view The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves Now what was that all about What was the point of the movie Why couldnt the surviving Atlanteans remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the present day And WHY did Atlantis sink and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw There is nothing left to think about or mill over except the loss of money in their walletsbr br The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 to the spoiler collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people The crew are a collection of quirky 2dimensional people of anachronistically for 1914 PC race and gender The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny short Most of the jokes are gross oneliners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons They are delivered at lightningspeed pacing and usually mumbled The way these supporting players do a moral turnaround near the end of the movie is hard to believebr br While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults and this is the first Disney not to have cute talking animals or objects it fails to make the transition Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles when the characters speak Atlantean In the first five minutes of the expedition approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought Obviously Disney thinks that if you didnt know who those people were then why should you care Again the movie has no feelings on any levelbr br Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well Sadly Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame Disney needs to get back to their roots A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it We also hope that the upcoming Treasure Planet a scifi adaptation of Robert L Stevensons Treasure Island will have more heart to it than the unfathomable Atlantis The Lost Empire,0
This film was hard to get a hold of and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming I mean this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt With all of this builtin interest how could anyone make such a lackluster talkladen flick of this truelife event While Williams is always interesting the screenwriters assumed that the DB Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star s what we get is a typewithout any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction Shame on this film for even existing,0

I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life I cannot believe that I wasted 10 at blockbuster this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues Who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense Well the whole movie doesnt make sense Also the part where those men come into the diner department of national securities that happened to be the worst part of the film How dare they say Frank Sinatras name in vain Also what is up with those glasses When the guy and girl are in the car and she drinks water you can totally tell that she isnt even drinking Also what is up with the freaky dinner guy And everyone knows that you dont stab tires you slash them,0
I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie I cant believe he even made this one Is he actually that hard up for money,0
I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what Ive gathered it will be interesting when I finally do read it and I will My comments will be based purely on the film As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did I was so disappointed it hurt This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish The actors were not well cast though Robards and Pryce are both good actors just not here The kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters clothes say the lines and make the faces The set and props were cheap and unrealistic The direction was surprisingly bad I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done The editing was cut and paste and the plot screenplay was just that as well even though the author had been involved himself irony The building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally camebr br Ive read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing It had so much potential Unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story,0
This is a truly awful B movie It is witless and often embarrassing The plot the basic making into show business routine is almost nonexistent In fact the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942 including the Mills Brothers Count Basie Duke Ellington Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack Each group gets about the standard three minutes the exception being the Mills Brothers who for some reason warranted two numbers Ann Miller doesnt get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propagandabr br The most interesting moment in the film in my view occurred in the Duke Ellington segment The band appears to be playing in a train standing in awkward positions In the deep South at the time the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke and Harry Carney may also be identified In the last moments of the film trumpeterviolinist Ray Nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an uncle Tom bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way Willy Best did in many films For modern viewers especially jazz fans this homage to segregation is sad indeed Some movies go best unseen,0
This movie isnt even good enough for the 1 bin at the grocery storebr br I only purchased it because Terrence Howard was in it Guess he couldnt be too choosy about his roles during this time br br The movie in itself was hard to sit through It seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline The guys night out had to be the most boring Ive ever seen One minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry Even the arguments were hard to follow Most of the acting lacked any depthbr br I have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark,0

Let me first state that I enjoy watching bad movies Its funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way This vehicle for Sam Mraovichs delusional ego doesnt just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words This should forever be the barometer for bad movies Sort of the Mendoza line for film Mr Mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben dead behind the eyes Sheets struggle for marital equality As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married Ben Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and hamfisted trademark Mraovich that you cant possibly take any of them seriously Arthurs brother Victor the bible toting Jesus freak is so horribly overthetop evileffeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role Thats because Sam multitasking Mraovich was also casting director The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself When you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind Sam also delivers lines like dominos pizza cold and usually wrong The final tally you suck at writing directing acting and casting Thats the Ed Wood quadruple crown Congratulations you horrible little man,0
Essentially a undistinguished Bmovie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden eras major talents Fritz Lang Even with the stellar names of Lang Walter Pidgeon Joan Bennett and George Sanders be prepared for a ludicrous storyline bad acting patently phony sets and miscasting For transparency sake I have to admit I am an ardent nonadmirer of Walter Pidgeon who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dreamfactory of MGM and somehow worked in secondary roles supporting Greer Garson and others He is wildly miscast acting in a chipper 30sRay Milland madcap comedy tone in a role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding Joan Bennetts cockney accent is excessive but her lacquered hair perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a streetwise Cockney slumgirl George Sanders is incapable of bad acting but disappears after the preposterous opening finds Pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler Surprising for Fritz Lang is the unevenness of tone I found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspensethriller surrounded by lighthearted comedic interplay Hitchcock totally reversed the ratio using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense There is a reason this film is unknown It didnt serve or propel anybodys career or reputation and is forgotten because its a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group,0
When oh when will Hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers I cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible storybr br No computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface It may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nutsbr br As for tracing people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way Network security alone would prevent that from happening The key stroke logging was laughable to say the leastbr br Regarding the software that was supposedly being installed no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested retested and tested again on a sandbagged systembr br But probably the worst possible part of the movie was the virus There is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system And as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds that just beggars belief There is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system filesbr br I could go on but I cant be botheredbr br A porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage,0

The Nest is really just another nature run amock horror flick that fails because of the low budget The acting is OK and the setting is great but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me The gore effects are not the best Ive seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way The roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people The Nest reminded me of a much better film called Slugs If you liked The Nest then Slugs is a mustsee as its ten times better Also worth noting is that Lisa Langlois who plays Elizabeth was in another nature run amock type film called Deadly Eyes aka The Rats which is about killer rats as you may have guessed br br If you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch but youd be far better off seeing Slugs which is far more interesting and gory,0
Marie Dressler carries this Depressionera drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month If you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the DresslerPolly Moran team youll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film Its also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from MGM Leonard Smiths bare bones cinematography is strictly from the set up the camera and dont move it school frequently to the detriment of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen its like a pan and scan print before such existed or having their heads cut off The film doesnt even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production Overall its an unsatisfying mess with Dressler frequently overemoting and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart,0
Cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value even on the so bad its entertaining front A friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing St Vincent DePaul clothes bin Okay that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin not a crappy old VHS bin something the less fortunate members of our society dont really need to make their lives better It could be considered a mercy Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only add to their problems Anyway the basic premise of a woman with a superpowerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isnt even properly exploited The two high speed chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 KMPH and a superfast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it There is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used at the films climax and it is laughably ineffectual or just laughable when it is This includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly The rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler Lots of bad actors yes even Combs and Landau suck in this most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot There are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop Comedy of the sub Benny Hill horny old man cant stop staring at the female leads chest variety Basically the money scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material Skip it,0
Might contain spoilersbr br Ok lets conclude this movie in one word bad Two words Really bad Now why do I think that Let me explain br br Guttenberg leads a specialops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some armsdealer stole it from a lab They do this by attacking the armdealers in midflight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting However suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name After debriefing the teammembers get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved After deciding they cant trust their bosses they decide to once again steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackersbr br In theory this is a plot that could have worked in a lowbudget movie that just aims to be aired on TV However the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts Firstly the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes Second The acting is really bad or the actors are directed to act as dummys There arent many emotions change of facial expressions at all etc I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg that I believe can do so much more but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough actionhero In addition though I am not by any means any expert on the subject I totally believe I could assemble a better covertops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week This seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible This go for good guys bad guys and bystanders as well Then I sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants if any of the film For example I have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and I didnt break instantlybr br Dont know how to conclude this really but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do Sorry cant be any nicer than that Do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny 210,0
The premise of an AfricanAmerican female Scrooge in the modern struggling city was inspired but nothing else in this film is Here Ms Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved Part of the problem is that storys roots dont translate well into the urban setting of this film and the script fails to make the update work Also the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end This is a message film that doesnt know when to quit In the title role the talented Cicely Tyson gives an overly uptight performance and at times lines are difficult to understand The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times its a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant in spite of its very relevant message,0
I have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear This movie is awful Beyond awful In fact so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is Skeleton Man In case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible Sure loads of people are getting killed by this skeletonpuppet wearing a ridiculous cape but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is where he comes from or why hes so angry with the world He looks like a crossover between Skeletor from Masters of the Universe and the horseman from Sleepy Hollow and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness The setting of Skeleton Man is another totally retarded aspect For nearly half an hour I assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods Huh Why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes Anyway after a couple of totally random killings a special commando squad led by poor washedup Michael Rooker arrives to come and hunt a monster they dont know anything about Really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces himherself as the expert in a certain field we have a sniperspecialist a tracking genius a drill instructor yet they ALL die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills The horror Gods must really hate Casper Van Dien as hes present again as well portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason crashes on the highway but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there Right that makes sense Furthermore the characters steal cool oneliners from Predator the boneheads horse constantly changes colors helicopters are brought down with bow arrows ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless Vietnam flashbacks haunt Michael Rooker I say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the IMDb bottom top 100 ASAP,0
Ill give writerdirector William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this illconceived thriller A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurbs A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad The dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst No tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing A few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer I feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing Good for latenight zonedout viewing only You have been warned,0

Laugh Clown Laugh released in 1928 stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito Tito has raised a foundling a young and beautiful Loretta Young to adulthood and names her Simonetta Tito has raised the girl in the circus life and she has become an accomplished ballerina While Chaney gives his usual great performance I could not get past the fact that Tito now well into middle age has the hots for the young Simonetta Although he is not her biological father he has raised her like a daughter That kind of ick factor permeates throughout the film Tito competes for Simonettas affections with a young and handsome Count Luigi Nils Asther Simonetta clearly falls for the young man but feels guilt about abandoning Tito out of loyalty not romantic love The whole premise of the film is ridiculous and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being until he reveals it himself at the end The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young who would go on to have a great career While I adore Chaneys brilliance as an actor this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy,0
Im sorry guys all who thought this film could be something great Im afraid you would be disappointedbr br The standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot So simple that the movie is not evolving until the end I asked myself if the plot wasnt about the action but about the main character played by Mickey Rourke but I found that the character was inconsistent either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother But both dont go together because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself Now Joseph GordonLevitt is a good looking actor but he played his character a little unnatural I didnt believe his acting it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldnt provide And he didnt have to because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough The only one whose acting was great was Diane Lane If not her i would give this movie 1 starbr br In conclusion I expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot And I completely blew it with my high expectations,0
Christian PropagandaLots of fear mongeringbr br This is not SciFi this is ChriFi Christian fictionThe movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn From then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil The ufos are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe Satans idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the biblebr br The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture The people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the Christians to heaven No reason to repent if its aliens The deeper message in the movie is that if you dont believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose,0

A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on Dantes Inferno there is nothing especially clever Dantes Divine Comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Artbr br I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political andor religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked Be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satirebr br The high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of Schoolhouse Rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door Its really a shame that the entire film couldnt have been a musical That would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun,0

Im glad some people liked this but I hated this film It had a very good idea for a story line but thats where it ended It was badly written badly acted and badly madebr br It had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross Instead it was whats going on 5 seconds later they tell youbr br This film had no suspense and I was bored from start to end I just wanted it to finishbr br Go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end,0
The Palestinian situation is fertile and asyet largely fallow soil for filmmaking Divine Intervention tries hard and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles but the film amounts to little more than a handful of admittedly lovely visual jokes thrown onto celluloid while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses A missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue,0
The distribution was good the subject could have been interessant and comic whereas he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving sensations Instead of this the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy,0
This story is dedicated to women according to the introduction who have been fighting for their rights ever since Adam and Eve started the looseleaf system When Politics was filmed the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote was only a decade old And the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group Advocating prohibition and shutting down speakeasies was a main concern for women at the timebr br Goodnatured Marie Dressler as Hattie Burns becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy She wants the liquorselling joints closed and is drafted into a Mayoral run after delivering a powerful speech at a womens rally Ms Dressler is supported by her tenants best friend Polly Moran as Ivy Higgins and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates as Peter Higgins Dresslers run for Mayor of Lake City draws opposition from men in town so Dressler orders the women to go on strike denying them everything in the parlor bedroom and bath br br The film sounds much better than it turned out The humor frankly isnt too good and it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations You look like Madame Queen refers to an Amos and Andy character And the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesnt mix well this time Producers might have considered making the film more dramatic focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell as Benny Emerson and Karen Morley as Myrtle Burnsbr br Politics 72531 Charles Reisner Marie Dressler Polly Moran Roscoe Ates,0
At the beginning of the film you might doublecheck the DVD cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times but no worries Its NOT Memoirs of a Geisha that you purchased just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be Still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery He decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment Cut to present day when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago From then onwards this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional Lets start with the good aspects namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my alltime favorite British horror wench well together with Britt Eckland Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress In this possessed state she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests So strictly spoken its not really evil that dwells in the house just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the lightblue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in Ghostbusters The House Where Evil Dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever Throughout most of the running time youll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films Motel Hell and From Beyond the Grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and overthetop like Motel Hell maybe But then again everyone in the cast continues to speak hisher lines with a straight and sincere face so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed The House Where Evil Dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesnt even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights Well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously oversized spiders or are they crabs in the daughters bedroom How totally random and irrelevant was that If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstepbr br Trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demonmask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba,0
If this film had a budget of 20 million Id just like to know where the money went A monkey could make better CGI effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although I must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original playstation 1 game and early PC games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made What puzzles me is where did the money go Pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la George Lucas circa 197583 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again I hated it completely I regress I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it I sold it to a guy for a dollar Im betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew Shame on you Pendragon films I want my money back,0
If you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters this is the one The acting is superb both from John Cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom as the saying goes they REALLY ARE out to get and from Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue Big mistake but since theyre both amoral mobsters and misogynistic bastards to boot its hard to decide whom to root for LESS Only writerdirector Elaine May could have gotten away with this one I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD he disclosed that the two stars had very different ideas about the script that the director was nearly impossible to work with that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting and so on This mood of one big VERY dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen,0

Hi Im a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least Althou i wonder why i havent heard of it beforebr br First of all the movie starts with tits Lots of tits Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to Who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shotsbr br So about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares Hes your average everyday biker Not even supertough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than youve ever faced before Just by describing her a tattooed bikertype of a guy Pretty original I even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes SPECIAL EFFECT I mean my god that letsplantreddotsoneyeswithcomputer effect has been used since the seventies It looks plain ugly here And dont get me started with the werewolf 3DCGI As said before like an bad and old video gamebr br And finally as i do like werewolf films like i said They prettymuch always build a werewolflegend of their own Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybridwerewolves and the ancient bloodline BUT It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts randomslashing Which just doesnt make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they arent even gonna play by them Aplus the wolfpointofview shots are made with a sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls Just add growling noises and youve got a super werewolf effect The gore is partially OK But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesnt do the trick for mebr br Truly WHO gives money to make these heaps of junk straighttovideo horrortitles they arent even funnykind of bad movies just sad,0
I had noticed this movie had been on Cinemax a lot lately so this morning I decided to watch it I had just finished the Infiltrator which is a great movie and I thought this looked good as well From the description the cable had atleast This film was awful Its slow the pacing is horrible it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours Theres no real plot to speak ofagh How can anyone say anything good about this movie Rickman is goodbut he always isthe other two characters work well but theres no real story to support any of it After 2 hours and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on where on earth is the plot it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick Dont bother with this one,0
Wow did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the Enterprise Is it just me or is this a really lamebrained idea Lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet where they meet other famous dead folksboth good and evil It seems that a really cheesylooking rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy The whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair as the GOOD side is saddled with Suraka Vulcan who makes Gandhi seem like Rambo Despite a totally AWFUL premise the action is pretty good and its great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match But dont mistake this for high art or deep scifi The bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a firstrun series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise,0

All the kids aged from 1416 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 They have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it I feel very sad kids cant see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is This was one of the worst movies i saw in months Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie And the end Its an open ending why Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story This movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when youll be scared br br When the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me These day i could make an Oscar with a homevideo of my goldfish if only i use the right marketing,0
Claire Deniss movies seem to fall into one of two categories the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate LIntrus definitely falls into the first category but its not so awful as Trouble Every Day or Jai pas sommeilbr br Now ever since I saw Chocolat Ive made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes And I have always been disappointed LIntrus was no exception She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one br br You get a lot of the Denis regulars an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample cleavage and a couple of nice coats the black guy from Trouble Every Day and Jai pas sommeil Grégoire Colin and that Lithuanian or Russian girl Michel Subors character was interesting enough but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when somewhere in Korea I think he finally got it cut br br There was certainly some actiongruesome murders a mans search for a sonand there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasnt enough to figure it out and two viewings are I fear out of the question For one thing the score was jarring and obtrusive as in Beau Travail For another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on Oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked Friday Evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets you might appreciate the aesthetics of LIntrus Otherwise steer clear br br I saw this movie in French and its possible I missed something crucial But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double spaced and with ample margins In Chocolat the silence is sublime in LIntrus its just dull,0
As someone who has read the book I can say that this is vastly inferior to the big American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow There are various reasons for this Firstly Emma is too unpleasant Yes she has faults and isnt the easiest person to like but the viewer shouldnt downright start to despise her Secondly Mr Knightly is miscast His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen and throw the mood of the whole affair off Thirdly Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet and why was she made to look so sickly Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming not to look as if shes going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene Fourthly the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut At the end when Emma decides she loves Mr Knightly it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasnt been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film Fifthly what was going on exactly with Mrs Eltons accent She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning to all out American halfway through and then back to English at the end Finally this dragged at the end The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly This version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremonybr br All in all a rather haphazard attempt Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead,0
This film without doubt is one of the worst I have seen It was so boring that I simply could not wait for it to end I talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say your nuts The scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around The acting was uninspiring and the film was simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a dvdrbr br Guy Pierce should have stuck to neighbours as at least he washed his hair All he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as a salesman He would have been sacked weeks before His girlfriend once in Coyote Ugly should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in thatbr br The guy who played Vincent those who watched know was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2br br I do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it I actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture I went through,0
This is the first porn Ive ever tried to review It demands a different approach than usual since the allegory will not reward dissection Im American Im a prudish virgin We are European We are cultured and sexmad It is nice when we all screw each other Lots to talk about Well there kind of is in fact relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway And the enervating patina of class at least delivers clean detailed compositions But what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn OK then the only scene I really rhetorically got off on was the first time Brigitte Maier steps in There are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus And multiple takes or not one perhaps undescribableonIMDb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose Still I stayed awake and it was eight in the morningbut what does the last shot mean,0

I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst Laurel Hardys For me it isnt as close to as bad as Air Raid Wardens and The Bullfighters but there are some definite huge flaws in it The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio Hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a London Bridge dance surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlets while in the next room Laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit A clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor leading to a predicable gag where Hardy ends up the looser Then in come the racketeers now selling insurance covering up their protection racket One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum But no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance they are arrestedbr br This is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio The rest of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardys support of wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her inventor boyfriend Robert Bailey They first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont and hopeful suitor Allan Lane whom we can tell right off is a nogood swine This leads to Briggs hidden bar being revealed to teatotaling Dumont and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below When Bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun pandemonium ensues The deadpan butler announces to Case and Dumont that their house is on firebr br Later Hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get Laurel to break a leg to do so There is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid Even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman after being arrested their licenses would have been revoked Laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog only a frosting covered cake devouring Toto lookalike or possibly the actual pooch causing Oliver to end up on a huge beach rollercoaster that somehow the bus has ended up on perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks Rollercoaster gags can be exciting as evidenced in Abbott and Costello Go to Hollywood and this one is amusing but anticlimacticbr br As the story wraps up all of these gags seem to have no point giving the impression that this was simply a series of onereelers put together to make a fulllength feature hopefully part of a double bill LH as Ive mentioned in other reviews of their later films had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roachs employ but surprisingly here they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year Had the gags not been as amusing as was the case with some of their other films this surely would have ranked a 2 as opposed to a 3,0
Sadly it was misguided This movie stunk from start to finish It was hard to watch because I used to watch Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon I LOVED her Then the next thing I found she did a spread in Maxim and she was gorgeous I havent really heard anything about her until I watched this movie on accident I couldnt believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it Everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship Too bad I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie,0
If you have beloved actors Peter Falk Rip Torn George Segal and Bill Cobbs you dont need Billy Burke Coolio or any other distractions Massive talent is totally wasted in Three Days to Vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script My neighbors vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out The Crew There really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime I wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with MERK,0
I just found out before writing this review that Komodo vs Cobra and another movie called Curse of the Komodo were both directed by the same guy Jim Wynorski That might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises They both feature a militarygoverned island a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok What differences are there Well the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and theres a giant cobra on the island as well hence the title Komodo vs Cobra even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the story Komodo vs Cobra is more or less what youd expect given its title and its channel origin the SciFi Channel Although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you I liked a movie called Komodo I hardly doubt this one willbr br Komodo vs Cobra is not only a boring film but its also one of the least enthusiastic scifi flicks Ive seen in a long time In some of these movies there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort but I see very little here Thats indicated again by it just being a rehash of Curse of the Komodo The CGI for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a secondrate video game the cinematography and misc en scene is poor the acting ranges from passable to poor the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly put unforgivably bad I see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and I can deal with this But in this movie where Michael Paré takes a single thirtyeight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading once well at first I laughed but even then it just became tiring That would be the action A monster appears people scream Paré fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture and somebody gets eatenbr br Komodo vs Cobra is a very bad movie The only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named Michelle Borth who is not only very beautiful but a surprisingly strong performer Even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given Michelle Borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this She obviously took it for the paycheck but it wont boost her career any Im afraid,0

This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians From a silly play by Tennessee Williams and directed with a dead hand by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward this project filmed in a spectacular clifftop mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967 The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor Burtons half asleep wanderings the loony dialog Noel Coward laughing at himself the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer BOOM is a disgrace a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planets plebs Not even fun Just terrible and mad shocking waste,0

i had no idea what this movies was about it jumps from plot line to plot line erratically linking incoherent ideas with one another it simply doesnt make sense br br the chopped up time line doesnt help either we start in present day get a flash back to the past and then return to the future only to go back into the pastbr br this movie is also filled with horrible sappy lines and cliché themes such as princess and the pauper you cant have me even in my death lines you dont even love me enough line cliché to the maxbr br fighting scene were horribly corny lighting was constantly misplaced which offset the CG with the actors meanning you could tell some of the backgrounds were clearly CG br br Although the society in di moon was quite interestingbr br i wouldnt really recommend his to anyone avoid if possiblebr br if you found this comment hard to follow the movie would be equally as bad,0
Another weak thirdseason entry Is There In Truth No Beauty nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say fascinating The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane Its too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise Obviously I think it was a mistake to ever show the alien as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting buildup all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar In any event Kollos appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr Spock and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor For the longest time I thought the aliens name was Carlos which I found humorous but I digress Spock is required to mindmeld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety This is accomplished but when SpockKollos go back to end the mindmeld by golly Spock forgets his visor Uh oh He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos assistant a blind woman with psychic powers This might have been a really bizarre excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series last season,0
This movie is trashpoor It has horrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on realevents which doesnt add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment Direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are outofplace Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story To start Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting Whats worse his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting d_ck_smker in good fun which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end Toni Colletes character is just plain annoying and a rehash of her 6th Sense performance with poorer direction Very Missable,0
This movie Vampires The Turning isnt even really worth the 2 out of 10 Im giving it The movie is very predictable from beginning up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the Vampire Slayers The use of music in this movie was even bad it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second though it never did The acting was BRank at best And the movie was just dull The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential though it ended up unable to deliver Oh and did I mention the wardrobe The wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to nonexistent because our hero and his girlfriend whom hes trying to save throughout the entire movie wear the same outfits through the entire movie Id suggest this film only if your really bored and dont have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry Dave the Horror Cowboy,0
A new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his coworkers to steal 42 million from the truck No bad guys so no one will get hurt right Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying manbr br Ill admit that I didnt really have any interest in this film but I didnt have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either and that film made my top ten of the year Armored is even more of a disappointment then I thought it would be As a heist film it fails to deliver the goods its boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about itbr br Despite this the film somehow has a really great cast but the film doesnt even use this to its advantage Everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays Mr Nice Guy at first then when things dont go his way he quickly becomes the villain The rest of the impressive cast include Lawrence Fisburn Jean Reno Skeet Ulrich Fred Ward Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros Non of them do much and when they actually do something its without much reasoning behind itbr br The film is relatively short but even with its running time under 90 minutes it felt dragged out How long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more restricted The leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so The entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money Pretend to get hit and burn the trucks They would then walk away with the money Of course something goes wrong or there would be no movie right Through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in How very excitingbr br The script calls for our hero to have financial problems he might lose his house which would in turn make him lose his brother You see both their parents died and its just the two of them looking out for each other So now he has a reason to join the heist At first he didnt want in but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things How convenient br br Armoreds whole spin on the heist genre is that its from an armored truck from the guys who drive it After that basic premise the film falls flat on its face I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke Speaking of the ending it sucks br br Skip it,0
For a really wonderful movie you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi good for any audience Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape it gets the movie up to a 2 I was surprised that these actors didnt have terrible sunburn they were so were not desert dwellers And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment but certainly not here Even the miracle scenes were contrived unbelievable And whats the point if you can belief anything in a TV story Talk about dumbing down I thought this Hallmarkmade movie was pathetic I can see why others hate Hollywood I dont just some of these corporate profit grubbers You dont have to be any kind of religious to benefit from Jesus of Nazareth but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored with nothing to do dumbeddown religious And for a real movie experience try Short Cut to Nirvana a very highly rated film,0
I saw the movie last night here at home but I thought it was too long first of all Second the things I saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what I thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before The things isnt funny in the movie fiancé hitting his girlfriend beatings The movie was way too longtalk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing Some of the things at the reunion were too much to capturelike the lady singingi felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here come on Perry you can do better then this,0
Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in English class This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen It totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present so the story is just really really dull Thank god the 80s are over and god save whatever man was actually born as James Bond III,0
From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful Cruel Intentions and how flat it landed Youll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont Then in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother That is if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasnt blonde in the first film Then the movie goes on you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past here called Danielle and a Cecile here called Cherie How original is that for a prequel Then it turns into a low budget Wild Things type of film with lots and lots of ohmy twists As I mentioned Robin Dunne was a very bad choice Not that he is a bad actor hes good He just doesnt have the charisma Ryan did Amy Adams who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time once again delivers But with all the talent in the world there is no way one could save this trash As a whole this movie feels like a Beverly Hills 90210 episode The score has been stolen from Cruel Intentions and Jawbreaker Yes they used the score from JAWBREAKER Couldnt they at least leave that one alone Youll want to pass this one If you want more Cruel Intentions watch Stephen Frears Dangerous Liaisons,0
This was allocated to the fans as the winner takes all match occurred between two separate companies the World Wrestling Federation and the Alliance an amalgamation of former WCW and ECW superstars Because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tagteam match the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match interfernce is necessary Each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches executes a special move and tags in a partner The storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of Vince that a member of the Allance would be fradulent and join the WWF It was obvious with that statement that the WWF would prevail Overall very innovative storyline but poor execution which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tagteam The remaining matches are just revoltingbr br Edge versus Test potent big boot by Test but this did not display the true talents of both starsbr br Al Snow Versus Christian good match but superflous to the payperviewbr br Taji versus William Regal the worst match of the nightbr br Immunity Battle Royal This was an outstandingly fun match to watch but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event only a wrestler who characteristically appears on Heat and is probably a WCW lightheavyweight reject ie the Hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainerbr br Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz The best match of the night Jeff Hardy executed a Swanton Bomb from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and Matt was wedged into the cage which appeared to be extremely painfulbr br Because Stone Cold was the WWF champion Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore Champion and Kurt Angle was a mole in the alliance all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of the Alliance were granted work after the matchs outcome except for Booker T who recently attacked a wrestler on Raw and will inevitably be given work Shane McMahon will return to television somehow and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of the Alliance to see Stone Cold out of work The WWF has done much better A match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better and what ever became of Casket and Iron Man matches,0
This movie offers NOTHING to anyone It doesnt succeed on ANY level The acting is horrible dull longwinded dribble They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for Complete garbage I cant believe what a laughable movie this was br br And Im very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing NC17 movie The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens Pathetic,0

I cannot believe how popular this show is I consider myself an avid scifi fan I have read countless scifi novels and have enjoyed many scifi movies and TV shows I really wouldnt even consider this true scifi Every episode I have sat through was like a lame watered down version of a Star Trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or excitingbr br Its basically a bunch of people standing around in ARMY fatigues talking about something boring who occasionally go through the Stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like Earth with people who look and sound just like Humans It seemed extremely low budget The characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts and the many attempts at humor fall flat It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it trying to be funny but he is not It is just sadbr br The movie was terrible as well There is so much you can do with a portal through space yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING This shows no imagination I actually thought the TV series Alien Nation from a few years back based on the movie Alien Nation was much better That show actually had good story lines and decent characters I wasnt crazy about Alien Nation but compared to this overrated crap it was greatbr br Also unlike the great new Battlestar Galactica series Stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely They should have at least updated the cheesy toilet flushing special effect of whenever somebody goes through the Stargate,0
If like me you enjoyed the first film Bruce Almighty my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any filmsense at allbr br Without giving too much away the story sees Evan Bruces nemesis coanchor from the first film move home with his family to the Virginian suburbs to Change the World with a new political path What follows is a rather farfetched and quite silly storyline which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience Unlike its predecessor Evan Almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of comedy tagged upon its misleading position of sequel to which some would regard a modernday comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature upscale audiencebr br Generally speaking Evan Almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values The acting omit Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production Additionally the cast includes acting legend John Goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movies entirety I didnt quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy Every other character in the movie especially the wife and kids deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a kingsize Kiev Be warned though it is the typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream familyorientated films so Id advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sightbr br It may seem the movie is worthless thusfar however it does have some promising aspects The CGI was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the Ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end The particles renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar Although part of me couldnt help but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were in my opinion too good for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughoutbr br Overall I view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and approaching the end of the film I had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content I had so far witnessed This wasnt the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits As I sat discontent I couldnt help but think the movie wasnt anywhere near as Mighty as I hoped for In many ways the film reminded me of a watered down Night at the Museum as it showed similar styling and characteristics but unfortunately was leagues below even thatbr br I give this movie 3 out of 10 as it is watchable but its definitely one to be avoided If you HAVE to see this film be prepared for disappointment as mildly entertained is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production,0
This movie is painfully slow and has no plot It conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job There may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic lightbr br I do not understand why it had a 78 when I decided to watch it I watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff No luck The IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes Anything above 65 was worth watchingbr br And my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie Hes not my type so my agreement does not mean muchbr br Sigh I give it a 1,0
As a flying and war movie buff this ranks at he bottom of my list It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a highschool play The acting script direction production standards and casting are all garbage The only saving grace is some of the flying sequences If the people they portray were fictitious I might rate it a 2 but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be actually did this Its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable WW1 personalities as possibleThere are many good WW1 flying films and this is NOT one of them,0
This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER I emphasize EVER made Whats worse my old hero Dolph is in it and hes starring it Jesus The story is actually quite good but the way its carried out made even my body hurt The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter The actors except for Dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you cant help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyre all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time This is 12 million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost cant be a cent above 1000,0
I very much looked forward to this movie Its a good family movie however if Michael Landon Jrs editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better Too many scenes out of context I do hope there is another movie from the series theyre all very good But if another one is made I beg them to take better care at editing This story was all over the place and didnt seem to have a center Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy theyre both great role models Plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story,0
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago After all this time the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young mans life The most of what I liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths The special effects were something Every time I heard her call out to them I would think Not that face again But it was a good movie I just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome And what I also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20s very authentic as well as the costumes being original,0
this could have been betterbut it was alrightit helped me get away from my boredomI didnt even wanna see itthe only reason i wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in ithe is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the moviethe ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b moviei give it a 4 out of 10,0

Watching CBSs Surrender Dorothy I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it not because its a television moviewith the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses it isnt any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TVbut because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine A single mother grieving the sudden death of her twentysomething daughter imposes uponand gradually becomes friends withthe group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident Adapted from the novel this teleplay gives us a group of selfabsorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid Aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us hes gay hears Diane Keaton say Surrender Dorothy and actually asks Thats from The Wizard of Oz rightno genius its from Citizen Kane Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage lots of kooky outfits but it doesnt sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way Here shes a crazed harpy who doesnt learn many lessons on her journey of selfdiscovery the movie quickly forgets its about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there I cant imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer muddled and baffling Its deranged,0

Southern Cross written and directed by James Becket is a waste of good celluloid and actors efforts A formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on its promise which this film does not It is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past It is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains unexplainedly follow them This was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other It makes one believe that somebody told Becket there was a ghost town in the Chilean foothills and he said Oh great lets do a shoot out scene therebr br Dont even waste your rental money on this It is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama,0
What can be said about such a pathetic movie br br Very bad acting The main actress seems to know only one facial expression fear mixed with weakness Like a poor beaten dog The other actress the one who plays the evil looks like the female double of Ozzy Osbourne with an awful red wig The other actors are so pitiful that they dont even worth being described br br Theres absolutely no plot The story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere we dont know anything about the meaning of 1111 nor who Rayden really is excepted the simple shes evil or shes a child of Apocalypse which is not an explanation We dont know why the parents have been killed what kind of danger is growing and why Sara was chosen As the film goes on we just watch pseudoscary scenes with a bad music Moreover the end doesnt tell anything we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the directors cut Theres no plot so no possible interpretation br br 1111 is just full of clichés It is so obvious that i couldnt help laughing For example the deserted library or the bathroom scenes ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind theres even the fashionable little scary girl as in Dark Water or The Ring Of course the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped Gothic girl dark hair red lips skinny black clothes Is it an obligation to make her credible I dont think so The psychology of Sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesnt make her credible nor endearingbr br Terrible direction as i said nothing original everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose br br There are some funny incoherences For example i dont know if ghost science paranormal course or whatever is taught in American universities In Europe it is really not the case teachers talking about negative energies or using unmaterial creatures sensors ridiculous Also how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a Super8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen AND how can you on this old film isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face I wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical filmbr br Eventually 1111 just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch But its an expensive way to fall asleep,0
I know I know Plan 9 from Outer Space is the worst movie or maybe Manos the Hands of Fate But I cant get worked up over those sockmonkey movies Of course theyre bad How could they be any good But if youre talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent the T rex of all turkeys has to be Yentl All the treacly phoniness all the selfabsorbed asininity that stains everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964 reaches its culmination in this movie From its lonely summit of awfulness Yentl looks back to A Star is Born and forward to The Mirror Has Two Faces There is nothing else quite like it What emotional undertow dragged Streisand out to make this movie I would rather not speculate and what audience she was playing to I cannot possibly imagine although Ill bet theres a nine in ten chance you arent a member of itbr br Nobel Prizewinner and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it It is a tribute to Streisands impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didnt commit suicide but went on to make more awful movies,0
When Jim Wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the Slumber Party Massacre series I was ecstatic I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years So production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped Then the announcement of a title change No longer would this new sequel be titled Slumber Party Massacre IV but Cheerleader Massacre instead I was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film I had waited so long to happen I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see itbr br Maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date A few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them I began to become apprehensive on Jim Wynorskis Cheerleader Massacrebr br Tonight I got to see the film for the first time in full length and I am still scratching my head As I read in another review Cheerleader Massacre is definitely NOT a new installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series but a slasher flick all on its own And a bad one at thatbr br Before I get into the specifics of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of Jim Wynorskis films I am I always thought him to be a true camp genius with a winner almost every time Yes his movies are made on shoestring budgets and dont contain the most topnotch acting around but theyre fun nonetheless They are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time From Sorority House Massacre II to Hard to Die to Chopping Mall Jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion One of the reasons why I was excited that this film would be his latest projectbr br Cheerleader Massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films I had seen this directorwriter create in the past Firstly the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape something I had never seen Jim do before The actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa rather than an escaped lunaticbr br Of course the film is littered with female nudity This is a Jim Wynorski movie were talking about folks But some of the boobshots seen here almost seem like they were done for time There is an extremely long shower scene containing the cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in Jims Sorority House Massacre II The girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same waybr br Cheerleader Massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least The opening scene is literally something weve all seen in HUNDREDS of past slasher flicks A guy and a girl making out on the verge of consummating their relationship whenyou guessed it Theyre hacked to piecesbr br Brinke Stevens who Ive never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo Were talkin possible cue cards here She recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original Slumber Party Massacre plays Why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new SPM I have no idea There is also two explosions seen in this movie that I am almost certain were recycled from other filmsbr br Not only does this film recycle FOOTAGE from past films but it also recycles the scores from other films as well Some of the music used in Humanoids from the Deep which was also recycled prior for The Coroner can be heard throughout the entire film There are at least two more as well that I cannot identify but am certain have been used beforebr br After sitting through this films horrendous acting ridiculous story nonexistent gorespecial effects and camcorderlike quality I am having some serious concerns toward Mister Wynorskis career Has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche Only time will tell Oh and lets not forget his newest film A new installment in the Sorority House Massacre films now titled Final Exam I think Im seeing a pattern here,0
I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so I didnt know who had done it at first The longer I saw it the more I started thinking Jesus this looks like an Albert Pyun flick Wasnt quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor Paulin must have adlibbed the many clever oneliners he shot out because Albert Pyun hasnt written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career Unfortunately Paulin doesnt have all that much screen time before hes gone and the movies the worse for it Lance Henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as hes done in countless other movies like this I dont know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it He goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent Kathy Long the nominal hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesnt have an iota of acting talent but that doesnt matter in a movie like this This being an Albert Pyun film its full of the trademarks that weve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured Ah nobodyll ever noticebr br As bad as this movie is however its a shade above most of Pyuns other effortsthis is Citizen Kane compared to his brainnumbing Adrenaline Feel the Rush for example The fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying Alright already go to something else and Long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great derrière Its not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but its not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as Pyuns usual extravaganzas You could do worse than rent this movienot much worse granted but worse nonetheless,0
The movie opens upon Julian Sands lying on his back a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it about two feet above him That was so provocative and I thought Here we go A good vampire movie br br And then it died That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination It was slow uneventful drivel thereafter I was vastly disappointed as my previous experience with Sands acting was quite enjoyable However this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desiredbr br Even Julian Sandss questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a moviebr br It rates a 1110 frombr br the Fiend,0
About twenty minutes into this movie I was already bored Quite simply these characters were fairly dull Occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again Fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasnt bad at all However it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes So I would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast Id call this a disappointment,0
This self proclaimed very talented artist have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century Lack of emotion coherence rhythm skills humor it repeats the same situation over and over again It shows no character development It does not even show any violent andor sexual content and it does not add anything new to the psychokiller sub genre So lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of what not to do in a first moviebr br BTW where the hell is the talent there are scenes which have been shot almost identically there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason The camera almost never moves as if the very talented artist was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills The actors playing the main roles act like amateurs and the supporting cast is hardly believable There are more holes than plot in the script if ever there was onebr br A really disheartening movie and a whatsoever talented director,0
Plot Melissa is a new girl in town shes fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week Since Melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously diebr br To be honest the real reason I wanted to watch this film is because Dana Kimmel of Friday The 13th pt 3 was in it which isnt a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie When I started watching it I realized that Sweet Sixteen isnt a very good slasher its really dull and boring and just doesnt go anywhere After over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasnt really developed in any possible waybr br The movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s the movie suffers from being too dark at times The acting is actually pretty good though and Melissas character is easy to sympathize with even though shes a complete slutbr br The story line isnt completely rubbish but its just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was Melissa she was stunning and Dana Kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this moviebr br All in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesnt go anywhere Id definitely wouldnt recommend it to Slasher fans,0
This film is a very funny film The violence is bad the acting isWell Dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexuallyfrustrated goth lads in Personally i think this movie really does suck The story and characters COULD be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better But the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it This film is possibly the worst Brate film ever And believe me thats hard to achieve especially when youre competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies Im not a CoF fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movieA really bad one If Dani made this as a comedy then good going him Very well done Over than that though i rate it low for its crappiness Watch it when youre in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if youre high on multiple different types of drugs,0
This barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through None of the segments are good but at least the first one was mildly amusing and the middle one was somewhat imaginative The final one was just plain brutal and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts the third one was truly painful to watch Even by the low standards of a National Lampoon movie this one seemed especially boring and joyless,0
A wasted effort On the surface its a typical disaster movie were involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the Big Event However the script is so awful and theres so much explaining of the characters background within the dialogue that we feel were being treated like morons Even Sesame Street didnt explain the origins of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died we can work it out Someone thought that entering Enron into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies The acting is by and large bland with the exception of the older performers Randy Quaid Brian Dennehy and after the first hour I couldnt care less about who the storms took outbr br But maybe there are the special effects to watch Sadly no Even on a 20yearold TV set I could see one tractor and trailer were computergeneratedbadly Maybe there are budgetary limitations so I can forgive that one Footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real but I kept telling myself I had seen that before This site confirms it it was from an earlier film Nowhere to Landbr br So in summary the only good bits are from another film and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30second network promo it makes Category 6 look quite good My advice rely on your network to do some good 30second clips watch them and save yourself two nights,0

Pet Sematary though a nice 80s Horror movie with a nice Director and atmosphere IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati Its clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the bookbr br The cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being Stephen Kind a famous American writer its totally normal that he can get away with this its obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movies with no budget and in part its crap itself but the original idea I repeat it its Italian director Avatibr br Let the world know,0
As an avid Gone With the Wind fan I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters Luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece When the book Scarlett came out I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together While the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as I was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable However I consider the six hours I spent watching the Scarlett miniseries to be some of the worstspent hours of my life Discrediting any of the original character traits so wellformed in Margaret Mitchells book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so wellformed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character In the novel Scarlett OHara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family After coming to an arrangement with Rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her OHara relatives in Savannah Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland to further explore her familys roots that go deep and is eventually named The OHara the head of the family While her duties as The OHara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners and instantly becomes a soughtafter guest at many of their parties She having been scorned by Rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry Luke the earl of Fenton until Rhett comes along in a clichéd nightonwhitehorse type of a rescue The Scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committedbr br I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision,0
Just like last years event WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was headlined by an Elimination Chamber match The difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value In reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany New York with the WWE Championship Those men were current champion John Cena Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies Carlito or Chris Masters And Kane Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998 and that was only for one night It was obvious he wasnt going to be the one either Last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by farbr br The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber It was then announced that Edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there With no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the Elimination Chamber match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in WWE This was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all nightbr br The undercard like last year was truly atrocious Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away HHH picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it Any payperview that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it The King pinned Helms who books this stuff and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his Mamabr br The women of the WWE also had a busy night There was the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which was won by Ashley and the Womans Championship was also on the line In a match I thought would have been left to brew till WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match Trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable futurebr br The opening contest of the night pitted soon to be WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish Edge obviously had bigger fish to frybr br So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 payperview calendar in disastrous fashion The only good thing from that is knowing that for the WWE the only way is up They dont get much worse than this,0

This film is mildly entertaining if one neglects to acknowledge its numerous incongruities of plot and sheer lack of believability Bruce Willis as The Jackal never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld Instead he bumbles about in broad daylight parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises Why this man has never been captured before or even identified is beyond me Not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring considering the price he demands for his services an exorbitant 70 million his methods are decidedly lowbudget and stupidbr br As for those in pursuit of him they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior They show no sense of expertise instead relying on halfbaked conjecture which sends them traversing across the country at their whim Incredibly these farfetched guesses maybe he bought a boat maybe hes in Chicago etc etc invariably lead them straight to the Jackal who yet again escapes their clumsy graspbr br Richard Gere whose Irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the FBI He actually makes a compatible partner if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals At one point he actually confronts the infamous Jackal but unfortunately the FBI although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight fail to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication What kind of operation are they running herebr br The film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever The supposedly stealthy Jackal acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer eliminating people for sport and writing on a victims cheek with bloodbr br The films action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic and many moments are ruined with melodrama This movie is poorly executed on many levels the one bright spot being the ever consistent Sidney Poitier Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch itbr br,0
Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend Dick Foran thanks to his affection for his friends wife Angela Lansbury This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his castingbr br There isnt all that much else here thats interesting though Lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious Theres an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter whos also in love with the femme fatale but the Burr character is pretty straightforward Its frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films Ive seen him in Theres no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that Burrs character is setting up the Lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably He does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesnt notice when she comes into the room I guessbr br A few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for TV,0
Purchased this film for one dollar and figured I could never go wrong my big mistake was watching it Enjoyed the acting of IceT and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about Los Angeles and the world of pimps There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires He gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up This boxer falls in love with the bosss girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts This is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy,0
Note I only saw approximately the last half of this movie so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate that being said seeing what I saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a onestar rating for this is enoughbr br In short its a dismalplot slaughter of the wonderful precursor NL Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase only it doesnt have Chevy Chase in it and it takes place in a generic tropical island essentially with no connection to Christmas at allbr br Ol Chevy probably didnt want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun instead they got the screwy Cousin Eddie who again was great in the original but in this he is just over the top and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting The attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it and considering that this is supposed to be comedy I doubt I need to say morebr br This is not to be seen for its qualities for it has none but for its failings and again how Hollywood is spilling its lifes blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buckbr br I think Ill watch the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just highbudget but mindless garbage,0
What can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do because this was harmful to my eyes and ears I am rarely this unsatisfied with a b horror flick but this movie couldnt even bring a little scare to a five year old The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that heshe should seem almost godlike like nothing can stop their maniacal rage but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus its a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because hes far too stupid to be dangerous All in all a total waste of film,0
This one isnt even lively enough to be fun Something is out there ripping people off offscreen after a spaceship crash offscreen while government executives investigates offscreen and bad actors says stupid lines onscreen including a guy who looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover The monster when it finally is shown looks like an extra from Robot Monster but there aint enough monster fu anywaybr br Fortunately its pretty short Skip it unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this,0
First I would like to apologize for my rating of 1 The only reason i give this film such a high rating is that I cant delve into negative integers All This is a spoof musings aside and while I certainly have tried to give it due consideration have left me with a certain notion namely This is quite possibly the worst film ever made On any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement Seriously I tried Im just as in to any indie bornforcultvideodistribution film as the next buff but seriously this movie sucked rhino ballsbr br Honestly if I had directed this film I would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide,0

One of the worst movies ever made If you can get through this movies without falling asleep then you are doing pretty good considering no matter how hard you turn up the volume you cant hear what the actors are saying and if you can acually see whats going on from the terrible film I mean hell if you cant find anything that works better use a Home movie camara AT LEAST YOU CAN ACUALLY TELL WHATS GOING ONbr br It is beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks and escape on video and further more how do people making this not know how terrible it is good god br br After what I have just told you If you are waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie there is nothing to tell a group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the woods and a bunch of people terrorize them or somthing to that whats more so an action movie than a horror this movie is of NO interest if someone acually likes this I litterally feel for you br br Absolute Trash not even one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent Plan 9 From Outerspace and have a ball,0

This movie despite its list of B C and D list celebs is a complete waste of 90 minutes The plot with its few peaks was very predictable It was so silly that I cannot believe that I am taking the time to even write a review of it Flex to his credit has grown in his ability to act since playing Michael Jackson in a made for TV movie a few years ago Tangi on the other hand has regressed as she was more talented in her role as Felicitys flunkie some years ago As I sat watching this train wreck of a film with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what I thought of this film However in an effort to keep my writings G Rated Ill simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an L LAME,0

Stranded in Space 1972 MST3K version a very not good TV movie pilot for a never to be made series in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on Earths evil twin Having a planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane as the earth but on the opposite side of the sun is a well worn SF chestnut the idea is over 2000 years old having been invented by the Ancient Greeks In this version the Counter World is run as an Orwellian perfect society Where for totally inexplicable reasons everyone speaks English and drives late model American cars After escaping from his prisonlike hospital the disruptive Earthian is chased around Not Southern California by TV and bad movie stalwart Cameron Mitchell who like his minions wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers a stylishly evil combination which I fully intend to adopt if ever I become a totalitarian overlord Our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien worlds three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home thus setting up one of those Man Alone in a Hostile World Making a new Friend Each Week but Moving on at the End of Every Episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s The Fugitive The Incredible Hulk The Littlest Hobo etc The curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence Somewhere between Stranded in Space first airing under the title The Stranger in 1972 and the MST3K version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie Prisoners of the Lost Universe So in 1991 the opening credits for Stranded in Space run under a few shots of three people falling into a matter transmitter and vanishing Its a sequence that has nothing to do even thematically with anything that is going to followbr br Just to add to the nerdy B movie confusion one of the actors in this nailed on footage Kay Lenz later appeared in a 1994 movie called Trapped in Space Knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and admiring looks from fellow trash movie enthusiasts if you could ever work out a way of manoeuvring the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot,0
I happened to catch this supposed horror flick late one Friday night I wish Id gone to bed Tell me Is a 3 ft tall raincoatclad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some sort of fear Not here yet Milow is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor Antonio Fargas who is three times his size uhhuh And the ending is so pitiful it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on whatsoever I found myself asking Is that itbr br Acting is about as good as itll get in a low budget film The aforementioned Fargas delivers a decent performance but it is my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn maybe one of the worse actresses to ever strut into Tinsel Town Sure cute face but bad actingbr br Rating 1,0
waste of 1h45 this nasty little film is one to avoid its like a cheap badly plotted cross between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap why the writer wrote this is obvioushe has no soul and did it to try and me some money The twists were obvious when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and didnt etc only good thing about it is Ive discovered 1 new actress worth watchingpeyton list dont watch shuttle though there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world Spend your time more wisely watch good films do some exercise cook a nice mealanything but waste your time on rubbish like this,0
Warning This could spoil your movie Watch it see if you agreebr br To think that we as humans can not learn from the past The futuristic society portrayed glamorized what Hitler believed obliterate a race of people in this case men for the benefit of society It made me sick to my stomach Also the plausibility of a Y bomb is insane Even in war our instinct for selfpreservation will prevent the extinction of humanity We made mistakes in the past ie Japan Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 45 but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in 63 during the Cuban Missile Crisis,0
Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathombr br A group of top quality actors in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana All do well with the scripts they were givenbr br So much for the good The average would include the sets Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big In the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK presumably to save money although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylonbr br Now to the bad The screenplay This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives blinded He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide why Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than Brief Encounter Gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint Walter Mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wont speak Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers Whilst Miss Mortimers breasts are utterly delightful I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson The word limit prevents me from continuing the listbr br There is a sequel which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased,0

what caught eye was his pointing out the application the term sacred history semitic faiths and myth non semitic faiths including course hinduism amused because ‘sacred history’ deliciously creative euphemism for ‘christian mythology’ concrete and real sounding the word ‘mythology’ have noticed over time reserved anglophones for any non semitic stories greek norse hindu buddhist roman etc whereas when comes time describing their own mythology anglophones use ‘scripture’ and never ‘mythology’ but think ‘sacred history’ even better implying there ‘real’ history and then ‘sacred’ history which true there history and then there myth and ends thus with exceptions like amitabh ghosh’ ‘the shadow lines’ the entire corpus indo anglian literature leaves little cold like making love through interpreter ,1

 indian feel pretty stupid right now our government said they attacked jem camp fine they said that resulted very large casualties media says there were much 300 dead but don know anything for sure pakistan has denied any casualties and has been fairly consistent with their rhetoric that indian formation was repelled quickly they couldn hit anything value and that they want peace that should talk that since violated their sovereignty they made symbolic attacks with ill intent they treated our pilot well overall been kept darkness our own government and pakistan has been relentless with addressing their populace they might doling out misinformation complete lies but absence communication from our own government they are looking more believable this affecting and feel defeated ,1

 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,1

 don think that surprising that right leaning politicians win elections around half the time the yes obama was president from 2009 2017 but before that george bush was president for years and before clinton republicans won out presidential elections between 1968 and 1988 these things tend back and forth like pendulum one side wins then takes things too far people put the other side charge for while the same most democratic countries different question but maybe the one you are really trying ask why immigration and nationalism have become hot button issues the last few years the 1990s and 2000s the right was more free market pro trade pro immigration because pro business but the last decade has because more nationalistic populist anti trade and anti immigration there are several explanations but every country going have different one for example europe has largely been driven the refugee crisis and the poor way that has been handled the various governments the began with the financial crisis and increase immigration under bush but has also been driven liberal overreach number social issues under obama top this you got social media replacing television the main way people get news that local incidents are often blown into national incidents would also note that both left and right the extremes are getting more attention you have sanders the facto leader democrats the corbyn the leader labour the melenchon doing quite well france etc ,1

"I have just finished reading kane&abel, i must confess that the author brings out delight in treating of the affluent class, as well as the final closing of the climax, the discovery of the real patorn of abel rosenoski was in my view flawed, It raises only question is that, if there was so much hatered and jealosy why the hell the willium kane would have to help the abel fisrthandedly and the hate him till his end. A very poor and dissopointing end to how ever a brilliantley told story. If the author had taken interest in developing of climax the story would be much better.",0
Cool music and okay graphics do not hide the fact that gameplay is poor and there are multiple bosses per stage. The controls are also poor and the gameplay itself is repetitive and frustrating. I would not expect the average audience (Or me) to ever get past the first level.,0
"When you read a book where the main character has the same name as the author, you would probably expect it to be autobiographical. But in this case, it is not. Shakers do not have families; they are celibate. In fact, Shakers never were even in Vermont and there is no book of Shaker. Aside from the base false premises of this book, the graphically violent incidents are also worth avoiding. From the opening scene of the cow giving birth to the scenes training weasel dogs by nailing in a barrel or violent mating of pigs, the lengthy, graphic descriptions can be quite disturbing. There are harsh realities of growing up on farms, but this book sensationalizes more than it informs. There are so many other quality books about farming and boys coming ""of age"" - choose one of them instead.",0
"Too wordy, only line illustrations and a flamboyant writing style ,which makes the text hard to get through, gives this book a 2 star rating. Page 16 seems to indiacate that the writer has very little confidence in your being interested enough to continue and has a paragraph entitled ""Why You May Want To Read Further"". The book does answer some questions about handspinning in general but, in areas where more detailed info should have been provided, there's nothing. For instance, I wanted to find out how long I should steam a skein of yarn to set the twist. Pages 199 to 201 tell me nothing (except that steaming is best for wool).If you've done some spinning and want a book that interesting in its approach then buy this book. If you are new to spinning or want good reference books for your shelf then you'll be much better off with ""Hands on Spinning"", ""The Ashford Book of Spinning"" and a subscription to ""Spin Off"" Magazine.",0
"This CD is a big disappointment. I really liked her last CD but this one falls short. It doesn't flow well and some songs have sounds that you would make if you were cooing a baby.

I have had this product sitting on my patio table for two days now and it hasen't trapped a single fly. It does seem to attract them though. I have seen two or three flys walking on the lid while two or three of them are landing on me. They walk in the holes on top and walk right out. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it. I will try to return it to Home Depot where I bought it and look for something else.,0

not long lasting really and makes the dog sick when she eats too much of the treat. I have to take it away from her after a few minutes so she doesn't eat too much. If she eats the whole thing she gets the hershey squirts (liquid stool frequently). I think a better long lasting treat is peanut butter inside a bone or kong FROZEN. That keeps her busy and she doesn't get sick.,0
The book is well written I can't deny that.. but the author seems too obsessed with her female Grey called Sinbad.. she doesn't even know that Sinbad is an Arabic name for males and not females. The photos indicate that the author is fond of cheap as most of the cages portrayed are offensively so. She even recommends that Birds be allowed to play with Screws and Bolts for toys.,0

Don't waste your time or money with this book. Field guide to mammal tracking in north america by jim halfpenny is the book you want. Allan a macfarlan is another author i recommend looking into, he has written about the same subject but has more detail.",0
"KRJ has the credentials, the knowledge, and the skill to produce an excellent book about mental health issues, and she has done so in the past. ""Night Falls Fast"" is not quite as good as previous efforts, but still worthwhile. It is informative, and offers the average person a real understanding of the phenomenon of suicide-- who's most likely to attempt and who to succeed, what their motivations are, how to prevent them, etc.The book is not without flaws, however: she repeats herself in a few places, and the organization isn't really good. In one or two places she actually contradicts herself, or fails to resolve conflicts between advocacy for the bereaved and the prevention waves of suicide.Overall, a reasonably good book that could have used a better editor.",0

"I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy, but was disappointed to find this a dark and depressing drama. It is a story about how being an alcoholic can affect a family and the journey they have to take to stay together. Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia play a married couple, and Meg is the one with the alcohol addiction. The saying about hitting rock bottom would definitely apply to this film. The audience sees Meg slowly spiral completely out of control, and how low she has to go until she finally is ready to reach out for help. Her family has to come to terms with the fact that she will not be the same person she was as a drunk. When Meg emerges from rehab, everyone is on edge with her - not only her family, but friends and acquaintances too. Everyone has adjustments to make.",0
"The idea of an interactive workbook is good, but this book is so riddled with errors, undefined terms, and grammatical/language errors as to be an embarrassment to the publisher. If you're going to publish a book by people whose first language isn't English, then make sure you get a very good copy editor and proofreader.",0
"The author writes about finding reputable lab breeders, but says nothing of the fact that there are so many labs (many of them purebreds) waiting in the shelter to be adopted into loving homes.Besides including breeder information, he could have also listed the names of organizations specifically geared towards rescuing labs from high kill shelters. (Labs4Rescue, PAWS, etc.) We adopted our lab puppy from Labs4Rescue from a high kill shelter in Louisiana, and he is a purebred beautiful yellow lab who was on the put to sleep list. It was very difficult to read the breeder information knowing now what I do about labs in shelters across the US.Please- consider adopting your lab from a reputable rescue organization!",0
"The first episode is stunningly bad, which makes it surprising how the subsequent episodes are uniformly excellent.Episode 2 - ""Roadblock Duty"" - ExcellentDepicts how terrorists are using civilians as human shields, and also hiding terrorists and bombs in vehicle trunks.Episode 3 - ""The Prisoner"" - ExcellentAggressive interrogation techniques, to the early dismay of a wimpy soldier, yield important intelligence that saves US lives.Episode 4 - Didn't see this oneEpisode 5 - ""Embedded"" - ExcellentThis episode dealt with 'jihadists' setting up US troops in a small town, by intentionally using a little boy as bait (making him run at the troops). The 'jihadists' had also pre-positioned cameras, to film the child they had killed, which the willing ""mainstream"" media accomplices replayed over and over, providing a propaganda coup for the terrorists.",0
"I was so excited to receive this item. I paid for 2 day shipping. I got it and the first time I tried to put them on the mesh on the top of the glove tore at the seam. My hands are large, but not huge and these are the XL size. They don't have a larger size. The gel was nice when I was hitting the bag with them so if your hands are smaller and you won't have to work hard to put them on, it might be a nice purchase.",0

"If I were Mr. Shapiro, I'd be embarassed to acknowledge my association with this book, much less do a book tour. The characters are stiff, cardboard caricatures of standard poorly-written novels. The short chapters contribute to a feeling of plot movement, but leave one wondering about true plot development. Background on the RU drug was interesting. The typos were numerous: aquittal, for one. Some situations were tritely absurd and the dialogue suffered. Sorry to say, Mr. Shapiro does better in the courtroom (how much of this book is attributed to him?)",0
This mirror is better for chopper style handlebars because the stem is short.I put one on a cylocross style bike that I had to lean forward and reach down to the handlebars.My arm was blocking the view.The mirror needs to be above the arm so the rider may see behind the bicycle.Most Chopper style handlebars are riser type so the mirror is above the arm anyways and the arm is not blocking the mirrors reflection.Installation was a little difficult because the brace that connects it to the handlebar nearly wasn't wide enough.

"I dislike the book for two main reason:1)the author hides information in essay-style paragraphs which usually end in phrases like, ""thus, we have proved..."". If you are lucky, he will somewhere state the theorem.2) because of 1) it serves as a poor reference book, which is the main subsequent value of a text after you have taken the course with it.I do share some of the enthusiasm that Richard has for the book, but only for those parts of the book that I already understood from previous work. We actually took the class together at UC Santa Barbara. And from what I remember, Richard was one of the few students who had anything good to say about the book. I think a better graduate text is Hungerford's or Grove's (""Algebra"").",0

"The best thing I can say about this incoherent, confused and ignorant book is that it is bad from the beginning. One need read only a few pages to discover that there is no point in reading any more.

There are errors like that on every page.",0

"There is no way this nightstand retails for the $300+ price indicated. I paid about 120 for it and it is not good value for the money. On the positive side...it comes fully assembled, the finish is ok, the drawers work. On the negative side, the piece may contain some wood, but is certainly not solid and the drawer pulls are very cheap looking. I tried to find replacements and could not find modern pulls that lined up with the holes in the drawer.",0
"A few months after the one year warranty was through, I was opening a can and just couldn't get it to lock on. This was a problem that had occurred now and then over the past few weeks, but was easily overcome with a few tries. This time, the blade and a little gear fell out onto the counter and that was the end of the West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener. No forcing or jamming was involved - they literally just fell out and I stood there as confused as you probably are reading this.Bottom line - it was good while it lasted, but I did expect it to last longer than this. Going forward, I think I'll stick with the manual opener.",0
"This is not music, and it should not be heard. Shania Twain claims to be a role model for young women, and i feel that is a disgrace to present herself in this way. She makes constant refences in this CD to women as being exclusively capable of ""going totally crazy"" and she says that wearing short skirts make her feel like a woman. she is proud to proclaim that she is not impressed by intelligence, rather she prefers a man who ""has the touch,"" or in other words can satisfy her physically. Her ""music"" certainly cannot be admired for its sound, it made my auditory neurons want to commit suicide. Even her slow songs, which i'm assuming were supposed to sound good, sounded like an underwater cow, I especially abhor the song ""From This Moment On.""",0
"The book has very obvious errors. For example, AES/Rijndael uses 10, 12, 14 rounds for en/decryption, and not 9, 11, 13 as the authors claim on page 395.RC2, RC4, RC5 are not based on RSA, as the authors claim on page 396. It does not even make sense for a block cipher to be derived from a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. RC5 admits a key size of 0 to 2040 (255*8) bits, not 0 to 2048 bits.There are so many more error that the readers should not take the technical accuracy of this book for granted.",0
"I think you have to be either an historian or a self absorbed pseudo-intellectual to fully enjoy this novel. I almost never fail to complete a novel once I start, but this was so painful to read and absorb that I just had to put it down. That being said, I have to admit that now I feel challenged, and will probably give this book a second chance someday.",0
"AVOID THIS THRASH LIKE THE PLAGUE!This is not Scooby Doo, once that all the characters were played wrong! The Scooby Doo cartoons are funny, and this is not funny! This is not even a Scooby Doo movie, this is a movie about 4 retarded kids and a ordinary dog who are involved on a stupid and mindless story. If you want real Scooby Doo stuff, go for the original TV serie and the animated movies that are the best you can find out there! I repeat: THIS IS NOT SCOOBY DOO! This is a thrash movie that was suggested by the original cartoon but the producers of this involuntary thrash got the ideas all wrong! A REAL THRASH MOVIE WITH NO FUN TO FORGET FOR THE LIFE! IF YOU REALLY LIKE SCOBBY DO AND ARE A CLEVER PERSON, AVOID THIS!",0
"I have to say that I am not familiar with anything that has to do with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of Willy Wonka prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!The film brings to the screen the story of a young boy whose dream of visiting the Chocolate Factory comes true. There he discovers all sorts of surprises that he never even dreamed existed.The acting is about average, the colors are nice and that's about it.In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.",0
"I was looking briefly at this book while at the grocery store and looked at the entry for my own religion. The information provided was not just biased, it was inaccurate. The publisher asserted that Mormons believed Jesus was the son of Joseph. This is not our belief. We believe that He is divine - literally the Son of God. If the book's publisher misrepresents a fundamental belief of my religion, I am left to wonder how it treats other religions that do not adhere to the Christian premise of the book. If you are looking for an academic overview of world religions, I suggestReligious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know--And Doesn't. If you are looking for spiritual enlightenment, I suggest you go directly to the source of the religion(s) you are interested in. Most religions have an official website where you can get non-biased theological information.",0
"It has been many, many years since I first read Atlas Shrugged, and I have been looking forward to purchasing the audiobook to listen to on my long commute to and from work each day. The book is contained on 50 (Yes, FIFTY) CD's, and when I set the first 5 discs and started the CD player, I was extremely disappointed to quickly learn that the man reading the audiobook has the most annoying voice I have heard in quite some time. He is overly dramatic and even changes his pitch at times when reading female characters' dialogue. I am going to listen through to the end -- I'm only on disc 5 today -- but this is a real disappointment.",0

"This movie isn't real. It's actually done in a Hollywood set and uses ""footage"" to convince people that this is actual footage. In the credits at the end of the movie it clearly says that this isn't a good movie.If this movie had actual footage, then sure it would shock me like it's shocking a lot of people. But now that I know it's fake, the whole point of this movie is pretty much destroyed. There's really no point in watching it unless you want to pretend this is actually happening.If you want fantasy scary movies, there's a lot better titles out there that are scarier.",0
"Although there is usable, valuable information in this book, overall it's just OK. There are a lot of errors that should have been caught. That lack of attention to detail in a listing or sales contract could land you in court.There was also some padding to make the book bigger. When the author tells you to make a list to compare brokerages, he includes the list three times so you can compare three brokers!My guess is, that in the future, the author will write a better, more in depth book about real estate. He knows the business and has been very successful. In the meantime, ""Your First Year in Real Estate,"" by Dirk Zeller, is a better introduction to the profession.",0
"Seriously... what the heck was the big tension in this dumb movie? A father wanting to reconnect with this kid after the world changes for the worse? ... and his colleagues are willing to risk their lives - and yes, die- so he can get to his son.

"I bought several of these to clean my glasses and shiny electronics such as my cell phone and computer. They are not as soft as what you would get at an optical or glasses shop - they have a very finished feel to them, more like polyester, less like silk.

"I saw Caligula when it was first in theaters. It was one of those movies that all my friends said we had to see, because it was so controversial. Controversial it is. Good it is not.I've heard through the years that Sir John Gilgud did not know that the part he was playing would be in a film showing explicit sexual acts and degredation. I find this hard to believe, given the producer of the film - it was Penthouse magazine.That said, Caligula is dull, dull, dull. It is only the scenes of horror and sexual predation that make this film rise above the sublimely mind numbing - and that's really sad.You know you're going to watch it, because you're curious, but just know this: after you watch this repugnant film, if you're anything like me, you'll want to bathe afterward. It's really a creepy gross film.",0

"Well, in my home God is many wonderful things, not a shaming and fear inspiring punisher. I was raised with all of these stories showing God's wisdom, mercy and love of the chosen people. God may have acted in a punitive way throughout biblical history, however, creating a fear in children the way this book does, is repulsive and does not teach a valuable lesson for today's standards. Children today are creative & intelligent and to tell them stories about how God is like their ""pappa"" needing to punish children who ""do not obey"" is insulting. Most definitely NOT a modern Jewish version of the important stories all youngsters should know. Perhaps this book should be re-marketed to other, more patriarchal religions who want to instill a fear of God.",0

"I love stories about ice and snow and I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The author has crammed in so many political and scholarly agendas that plot and characterization seem like afterthoughts. Not that I disagree with those agendas, or couldn't be convinced, but this could have been done with more subtlety and skill. The stilted style may be an attempt to imitate the exploreres of the period, and sometimes it succeeds, but more often just comes off as bad writing. The bits of history (human and natural), which were the main draw for me, got lost in the unconvincing and blatantly revisionist struggle between Erasmus, 19th-century New Age guy, and ruthless powermonger Zeke. Ho, hum.",0
"After waiting for this latest Navy SEAL book to come out I was very very disappointed with this latest story from Suzanne Brockmann who has always previously delivered exciting adventures complete with every woman's ideal hero. However, after reading all her other books I felt Cosmo Richter was not given the strong character image he deserved and felt extremly annoyed on his behalf. Jules Cassidy was the only saving grace to be found to lift the story. I did enjoy the way he was written even if he did'nt have a happy conclusion this time around - hopefully the next story will see him finding someone worthy of him and also bring back the magic to the rest of the characters.",0

"I really did not enjoy Watership Down. As a student in juinor high school it was very boring to read. I did not want to read a book about rabbits and their problems. The book did not match my interests, so it made me dislike it even more. If i didnt have to do a project on it, i would not have finished reading the book.",0
"I was able (with considerable difficulty) to follow this book up to Hour 7.However, Hour 8. just lost me completely.Tried to follow the Listing examples 8.6 and 8.7 but didn't have a clue what ""It's just an include file, so don't add it to the project"". No explanation what a project, source file, header file or their relationship to each other. Informal remarks like this are downright misleading to anyone learning the language.It may be simple to you, Mickey Williams, but you don't explain the subject particularly well.Definitely NOT recommended.",0
"I can't even bring myself to chapter two, that is how much i hated chapter one. if a book doesn't get me interested after chapter one, forget it. I give up.I was very disappointed in this, I liked Interview w/ a Vampire and thought I'd read something scary in lieu of Halloween being so close by.This is just pure drivel. I had the book for three years before I picked it up to read it. It was a gift. thank god i didn't spend money on this terrible book. I don't know what she is talking about in it, it's like reading a text book..boring!skip this if you want something scary...this will put you to sleep.",0

"Wow, this movie really was disappointing to me. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks ""The Omega Man"" was a much superior movie but I call it like I see it. Just watch one, then the other , and you tell me. I thought this movie was choppy and rushed. You couldn't get a real sense of the character's situation like you did in Omega man. The vampire creatures were really not believable...how come when I have a virus I don't have the strength to run fast and tip over SUVs? Whats wrong with Hollywood? The Omega Man was believable to me. The characters were more believable and the story was too. This was just not even worth my time. Lame, Hollywood, lame!",0

"The book, which promises an insight into the workings of a forensic entomologist, falls very short of my expectations. The cases that are reviewed do not go in to much detail about how the insect evidence was actually analyzed but seems to diverge into how everyone else contributed to the cases. It was a lot of moralizing and not much content. After reading Dead Reckoning, which does deliver some content this book is a true disappointment",0

"I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire at the recommendation of my daughter, who had read the book in print form and loved it. I was very disappointed that formatting had been lost in the Kindle form. The print starts about halfway across the screen of the Kindle, then doesn't have enough room to finish the line, and wraps the text (usually a single word or two) to the next line. On some pages, toward the bottom, there is print to either side, which belongs with the story on the page. The reader needs to decipher where those particular words fit on the page, to keep the flow of the story. The illustrations which go with the print version of the book, and are hilarious, are not present in the Kindle edition. If I had spent money on this, I would definitely want a refund.",0
"this armoire is really disappointing. and usually I love Melissa and Doug items. it is smaller than I expected. too small, really, for the American Girl doll clothes. the dresses are longer than the space and end up hitting the bottom because they can't hang straight all the way down. more importantly, none of the hangers I have from several different sources fit!! the diameter of the hang bar is so big, the hangers can't fit over it which makes the entire piece of furniture useless. take a pass on this one for sure and spend a little extra money to get a bigger, better item elsewhere.",0
This book is a total waste of money for someone who has read Ask And It Is Given. This book is a total rewrite and contains nothing new.,0
"If you are expecting random violence and nudity, this is not the movie for you. It is kind of entertaining in parts, and funny sometimes, but I felt like I had to force myself to sit through it just because of the Troma label.",0
"As much as I loved books 1, 2 and 3, I was deeply disappointed in 4 for the same reasons others have stated: the book is sorely in need of an editing. Martin is a very talented writer and I enjoyed the book once I lowered my expectatons; but I was deeply discouraged to lose another favorite author to bloated book syndrome. I have nothing against massive tomes provided they go beyond the plot equivalent of playing with your food. My former favorite author, Robert Jordan, has done the same with his last several books. Have these authors become so big because of their early successes that no editor feels worthy enough to call them on the carpet for their self-indulgence? Ultimately, he is the author and is free to do as he will. But it would be nice to be respected as a reader by authors delivering on the goods and not padding a series, whether for financial profit or just because they enjoy writing the series so much.",0
It was scary in 1973.In 2010 it was scaringly dreadful tripe.I actually found myself wondering whether Sutherland used a stunt bum.,0
"As a huge fan of Catrow's illustrations, I really looked forward to showing this book to my son. And the pictures were great, which is the only thing that saved this book from a one-star review. The text is awful. Many of the verses don't rhyme, and they don't follow the meter of the original ""I Know An Old Lady..."" properly so reading this out loud is very awkward. The ""reasons"" for swallowing everything are boring and the ending - why she wanted the bat in the first place - is a big letdown. If you like Catrow's pictures as much as we do, this is worth a look through. But as a funny poem it fails miserably.",0
"I personally liked the older movies, to which this one was compared, much much more. It was full of special effects, but aimed toward the lower age groups, I believe. Entertaining is about all I can say for it, but if you miss it, you'll live! If you are looking for something to fill time, this one is probably a good bet.",0

"Pope Joan is one of those books which make you think based on its concept; unfortunately, the writing and characterization is awful. If Danielle Steele were to write historical fiction, this would be it....The concept is fascinating; a woman, disguised as a man, becomes an inspirational doctor and eventually the Pope.Could it have happened? Blows my mind to think about it. Cool stuff.Could it have happened as written by this author? No, not at all. The depiction of Joan as a youth is terribly unrealistic; the language she uses is not authentic, not even for a gifted child. There is a romantic sub-plot which is not believable, and seems to be thrown in. It is not consistent with the overall characterization of Joan.If we're lucky, maybe it will be a movie-of-the-week with Tori Spelling sometime soon.(Note that the afterward is surprisingly informative)",0
"The original Halloween (1978), is one of the greatest and most suspenseful horror films of all time! Halloween 2 was a good sequel, and I don't even remember parts 3,4,5,and 6. However, Halloween H2O is much more suspenseful and entertaining film than Halloween Resurrection. Even Michael Myers doesn't seem to care about the element of surprising his victims in this new installment. He doesn't even stay hidden for very long, before he kills again, and again, and again! Halloween H20 was the perfect ending for this series. My wife and I were staring at each other at the end of Halloween Resurrection in disbelief that we actually sat through the whole movie. The only DVDs from this series that will be in OUR library will be the origianl Halloween and possibly H20.",0
"This was the first Shannon Drake novel I have read. I did not find it all that great. There was not enough suspense in it for me and, it started to get boring after the first hundred pages. I could not really get into the story.",0
I wish there's an option for 0 stars. This is one of the worst albums ever made...an artist that capitalizes on sex to hide the fact that she cannot sing.

"The never flat ball was flat when received. We live overseas and the ball was shipped via air. I'm not sure if that caused the ball to go flat. We had ordered two basketballs at the same time.

I bought this set for my husband's shop and he is the only person to use it. Two days ago the DVD player stopped dead. We used the cleaner and it worked fine with that. We played a CD on it and that worked fine but the DVD will not work and it will cost us almost 2/3 of the purchase price to see if we can get it repaired. I am very disappointed in this item. It is the second Toshiba DVD player that has stopped working with no warning. I won't be buying this brand again.,0
"This is my 3rd and last Casio camera ever. This one broke (starts up with a ""lens error"" message and shuts down) after 6 months of gentle use. Casio wanted to charge me $135 to fix and said the warranty on factory reconditioned items is only 90 days. I thought fact. recon. was supposed to mean brought back to new condition? Regardless, I owned two other similar Casio cameras EXS500 and they both broke with the same lens problem. One broke at 11 months and was covered, the other at 15mos. and I had to junk a $220 camera. So maybe it's my own fault, but the least I can do is share my experiences with others so maybe they won't suffer a similar fate.",0
I am a fan of Masterpiece Theatre productions as well as British drama and that's why this was especially a HUGE disappointment. Poor color quality and poor sound throughout. Fairly boring story. Possibly could of salvaged it if the actors didn't put you to sleep. Tedious to watch. Marketing this as starring Sir Anthony Hopkins (as I see Amazon has done) borders on fraud. He doesn't make an appearance until Part 11 - halfway through tape 5. The set is a total of 6 tapes. Hopkins was the only performance worth your time. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.,0
"The first 3-5 lines of the following pages were poorly printed and the remainder of the pages were blank. The defectively printed pages were 291, 292, 293, & 294 plus pages 299, 300, 301, & 302. I have never before received a defective book from Amazon, in spite of the large number of books that I have purchased from them.",0
"Save your money and your time, steer well clear of this book. Annoying, new age, sensitive new age guy, left wing, metro-sexual, wanna-be intellectual gibberish. If you want to emasculate yourself and appear sophisticated while doing it, then this may be your thing. A well know person from the PUA community recommended this book in one of their products, maybe this explains the undeserved high score for this book. He's a very good sales person with the gift of the gab and people hate to admit to themselves that the recommendation is bad, considering how much they paid for his products and how much of an oracle he's meant to be.If you are looking for a great personal development book for men, then get your hands on a copy of Dr Robert A Glover's book, ""No More Mr Nice Guy"". Also on a lighter and un-PC note is the very funny, yet a lot of truth to it book, ""Nice Guys Don't Get Laid"" by Marcus P Meleton Jr.",0
"I tried this model from Capresso and was not impressed with the performance of the machine. Too long to wait for warm up and for finally brewing espresso. Espresso result was marginal.It appears that it's an entry level machine yet the performance from my Briel CHAMONIX machine is much better for about the same price. The Briel unit has the automatic espresso flow feature which is a great bonus.I'm sure that the higher end Capresso units are better in terms of performance,but I'm going to pass on the Thermocoil.",0
"Okay, I am not going to totally diss this movie. But personally, I hate movies with Arnoald what's a netor, or what... For the story line, and the very very neat graphics this was a let down. It was a little slow, and you had to dig to understand the stuff, and it's all church, stuff and things, and it was really kind of bad. For me, I didn't like it at all, But for other's they probally wouldn't mind. But if someone asked, I'd say... No, and that's what it's going to stay at.",0
It's just an expanded version of a Globe or National Enquirer short --- soooo stupid.,0
"This book needs an editor. Did they just let McCarver ramble on and type what he said word for word? You literally drown in McCarver's stream of consciousness. There is no organization of thought. Ideas do not flow from one topic to the next. I gave it two stars because I feel there is information to be found in this book if you are willing to wade through the rest of the mess. It's not McCarver's fault, he's a baseball guy, not a writer or publisher. Check it out from your local library and save yourself the money. I'm returning my copy.",0

I would definitly NOT buy any Uniden products in the future.",0
I just purchased and listeded to this CD. I was under the impression that it was a dual disc with both CD music and DVD music. WRONG - its a CD only. I likely would not have bought this if I woulda known it was not a Dual Disc with DVD stuff. Well Botti is good and there were 7 tracks that I liked and I moved the others to a NG folder.,0
"I guess I was not familiar with the term ""bead crochet"", but this book is not what I wanted. I was looking for books like ""Crochet with Wire""By: Nancie M. Wiseman and ""Crochet Jewelry"" By: Sophie Britten.This book covers Tubular crochet, and crochet that the beading looks more like Pave-studded fabric. Most of the projects look like somebody just tangled a hodge podge of beads together. Not one of the projects appeals to me--they all look very 'hippie' and outdated.I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before I bought this one.",0
"I expected so much more than the re-done and over-done blood and guts that fills this book. The best part was the two older women in the boarding house. They are described well and in detail where the other characters just come up short. This is a sci-fi/alien invading plot that focused on one town out west. The children involved live to their adulthood plagued by the horrors they saw one summer. Now the alien is back to finish what she started. If you can make it through the first half, (that's a big IF), the second half is a bit more interesting. Good Luck if you give this book a chance. I would not read it again and I wish I never read it the first time.",0
"After The Thin Woman, I had expected more from this novel. Rather than the crisp prose that I anticipated, the writing in this one meanders from scene to scene without much advancing the plot. It was just difficult to maintain interest in a work that I found more tedious than engrossing. I didn't find much to recommend it.",0
"This is the first and only Vonnegut book I have read. I was unimpressed. The dialogue was mediocre. The characters were mediocre. The plotting was mediocre.

"Before Springsteen was against taping his shows (...""all you bootleggers out there in radio land, roll yer tapes, a 1, 2, 3, 4..."" some of the best material was found from FM sources.

"It's an interesting notion: follow a young lawyer's climb up the ladder of civil litigation and his subsequent fall. Too bad Grisham's Clay Carter merely coasts along.There are no stirring courtroom scenes: all the action takes place on cell phones between lawyers. There's no mystery during investigation. There's simply no investigation; a mysterious source provides everything he needs. Clay never questions the man's motives. He never questions the origin of his information. To be honest, he doesn't do much of anything. His career is handed to him, his demise mostly the result of unforseeable events. People come into his life, and most leave with barely a blip.Grisham scratches the potential of civil suits, but doesn't dig deep enough to shed much light on the topic. He implies dark secrets, but nobody bothers to search them out. This book isn't bad, just bland.",0
"I have to admit to reading this book due to the movie hype I have seen recently of it. That said, I'm certain this will be one of the rare instances we find the movie to be better than the book.While the story line had such promise, the principals are obviously wounded but boring. Character development would have made this so much more interesting and a little more tutiludge of the era would have drawn us into the period.",0
"I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already. However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones. My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore. The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one.",0

It was a waste of my money!",0
My wife ordered this thinking she was getting glass and metal not cheap plastic. Obviously it serves its primary function - feeding birds. It's a little too big to be included in a Happy Meal.

"I only gave it a star because it is a required form field. There are no stars in this book, just a bunch of pathetic losers. I would recommend reading the Bible both before and certainly after reading this painful screed. I was not the least bit surprised that there was no chapter on China, however there is an entire paragraph on astroturf. I would not wish this book on my worst enemy, however, making the prisoners at Gitmo read this might be the perfect torture without leaving any visible evidence. They would however be scarred for life. Please consider donating what you would spend for this ""book"" to your favorite charity ie. PETA ACLU etc. Bill and Hill don't really need the money.",0

It was shipped with the wrong pedal and had to mess with getting the right one shipped and now 2 years later, that same pedal is now coming off and it appears that the arm for the pedal is faulty and now have to deal with trying to get it fixed and the warranty period is over. So just 2 years after purchasing, am having to once again deal with trying to get it fixed. While the bike has been good to work out on when the parts work, its not the quality I'm used to seeing with past Schwinn products and given the price and the problems I've had, I do not recommend it.

"Do not spend any of your hard earned cash on this. Even though I got it for free, I find it barely useful. Problems, oh yeah. First, it doesn't seem like it was actually designed for the GBA. Also, you are NEVER, repeat, NEVER going to wear this as a shoulder holster. The GBA fits inside sort of and I can almost fit a worm light in the case with the GBA. Almost! You can put a couple of games in a little mesh pocket insde with the GBA but when you open the case, WHOOPS, the pocket doesn't hold the games secure and they just fell out of the case. Hope you noticed. Tip for others, that game you lost, check under the seat in the car. I cannot possibly convey what a disappointing product this case has been. It works only slightly better than the bubble wrap envelope that my GBA shipped in.",0

"While reading this book I kept having to go back a few pages to an entire chapter to see if I missed something. The story jumps around in such a way that it is difficult and sometimes impossible to figure out what has happened.The parts of the story I understood I liked, not loved. Apparently this book took some 13 years to write, and I think part of my problem following it was when the writer would set it down for a year or two then pick it up and start writing in a different way with a different idea of who the character was supposed to be. I could be wrong but that was the idea I got from reading this book.I heard my friend raving about how great this series is, I picked it up to see what she was talking about. After reading it front to back (and several chapters two or three times) I still have no idea what the fuss is about.",0

"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2.",0
"I have gone to a museum and seen more life in a skull, than in the film The Skulls, a cheesy teen thriller about a college student who reluctanley gets into a secret society, named for the title, The Skulls and then procedes to find flaws in it, only then wanting to get out, and discovering the only way out, is to die. The only thing thats worth watching in this bore fest is Lesley Bibb, who we dont even get to see as much as we'd like. There is no suspence in this suspence, and no depth with the charactors, other than that they would pretty much do anything to get into a ""secret society."" The directings not all that bad, but it doesnt help, the actings not either, like i said with the exception of Bibb, and the writings not even all that swell. The Skulls did resemble a teenage version of The Firm, which was a way better film all together, but what can you expect from the whole set of the WB. Just kidding.",0

"why do nearly all gay themed movies have to be so bad? i was particularly excited about this one. a contemporary gay romance that deals with technology and social networking, sounds promising. unfortunately the acting is a joke and the script is boring. the dialogue falls flat in every scene and it somehow manages to be predictable and unbelievable at the same time. the character development is non-existent. you never really get to know who these people are and what motivates them beyond the surface level. there is no depth to the plot and a photo-montage is not enough back-story to adequately convey the connection the two main characters are supposed to have with each other, but never really comes across. this film is a waste of time and money. just don't even bother.",0
I bought this book 40 years ago. I loved it then and still enjoy reading it.It's a wonderfully written book.Now that I've just bought the Kindle Reader I wanted to have it in my Kindle collection at my disposal.To my dismay the Kindle edition has many typographic errors. Most of the comments by the nuns in French are ill copied.There are besides numerous mistakes in English.A simple ortographic revision with a text processor would have sufficed to correct them.I don't think it's fair to charge for a faulty product.,0

I'm a seasoned C/C++ programmer just starting Visual C++, and I was left confused to the Hows and Whys of the code. Although to the credit of the author, the code is almost bug-free.",0

I received Tudors as a present from my daughter. The first set had issues with a lot of scratched up disks making it impossible to properly hear or see what was going on. My daughter complained and a second set reached my home. This set was actually worse than the first set. The first disc was tremendously scratched up and could not be used. It seems to me that there is something wrong with DVD's sold as new that are so defective. Where did David Pereira get them from??? Perhaps he should get his money back. Also the discs seem to be numbered incorrectly.,0
"This book was a disappointment. While the subject matter was very intriguing--the life and loves of a famous woman in Europe at the beginning of the century, I found Phillip Max writing unbearable. He does not manage to give any depth to his characters. We learn about Alma and her inconsistences and caprices, but we do not understand what drives her. The reader is left to his/her own trying to figure out why Alma and the people around her act the way they do. At points tedious, the story rushes through Alma's life and does not leave the reader with a real idea of time.The only plus to this novel that I found is that it sparked my interest to look for Alma's autobiography--I would never think to rely on Max for even a fictional perspective on her.",0
"I got disappointed after the first use.I was making pancakes and spatula literally MELTED. I still can't take the leftovers off my brand new frying pan...And when I was cooking meat next time I used another potted spatula.. Guess what happened?????YES! It melted too!

"I saw this movie and thought Finally!! someone made a movie based on the wonderful book by Dennis Danvers. Rented and blech! Terrible. Not at all like the book. First of all they changed the biologist's name from Erik to Dan. Then they make him a penguin biologist. Give me a break! He was a wolf biologist. Then they add in the parts like the wolf eating a little girl. Never happened in the book. and the worse part was the ending. Erik/Dan is suppose to stay with Alice. But whoever made this film did a total 180 and had the guy go back to his ex-wife. Shudder and gag. As werewolf movies this was marginally ok, especially with the effects. But the low rating is from the fact that it is totally and completely different from the book that it is suppose to be based on. If you want a good werewolf video, keep looking.",0

"I have to admit that it appears that Amazon reviews suffer from the same problem as performance appraisals - everyone is outstanding. Too often I find that a book has lots of five and four-star reviews, only to find that, once read, the book just wasn't very good. And this book is not just not very good, it's no good at all. The writing is just so amateurish, the plot, as one of the other reviews suggested, is way full of holes, the ending, trite and completely disappointing. The book is an interesting idea that died on the vine.So we have to understand that Dick was a little nutso to appreciate his work? Sorry. This may be a good example of therapy for a sick mind, but that doesn't make it a good book. Sheesh...To balance all of the five-star reviews that, I think, are way off base, I give it one star. Come to think of it, forget balancing the five-star reviews. This book deserves one star on the merits.",0

I should have read the description better. This is a book not an instructional video on a zumba class. It does come with a video but it is mostly music to use to teach a class. The book has good heath and eating tips but this is not what I was looking for.,0
"I am surprised to see this book rated so highly, because I really didn't think it was very good. I picked it up at a hotel in Europe while I was travelling, saw that it was on the New York Times bestseller list, and figured it had to be pretty decent. But I had just finished reading The Kite Runner, Bel Canto, and the Kalahari Typing School for Men, all of which I thought were very well written. It's true that she tackled some difficult subjects - and that's where she rose above Danielle Steel - but I didn't find the characters all that compelling, and the writing was uninspired.",0
"This is a hard album to review; if the Dokken monicker were missing, a good third of this is one deadly post Seattle record, by way of Kings X. But it came out as Dokken so in spite of some forward moving riffs, and spitfire guitar solos (remember these were still out of vougue in '97), this gets weiged down with all of the baggage that this once gleaming star from L.A. has now been reduced to aping a genre that is from Seattle, which might as well be Mars. (and guys, there's nothing wrong with Seattle writing, it's CLOUDY up there 10 montns outta the year, what do you expect their songs to sound like? freaking sunshine?) Third song in and this little experiment pretty much nosedives, picks up again with some head snapping riffery, then back down into that massvie puddle of woe. I'm tellin' ya though, put this out as an unknown breakout act, and it would've been a different take. Don's psychedelic meanderings not withstanding. Paste this review to ""Dysfunktion'",0
"I'm not a literary reviewer or a writer, I'm just a third year Sociology student at the University of Windsor who is being forced to take a statistics course...and forced to use this text. It's bad enough that I have to take the course but, to go and dump on me, probably THE most difficult book in the world to read, is just too much. The definitions are uncomprehensible, the examples are useless and the explanations are so overly worded you can't even make out what the point is! On top of all that, the chapters aren't in any type of sensible order and as if all this wasn't enough....the darn thing costs well over $90 (for a book I will never use again!). In sum, the worst possible choice for a statistics course text and a complete waste of money!!!",0
"The book starts off well, showing the history and biographies of the stooges. Then, it takes a turn for the worst...and completely disregards Curly and Shemp. Looking through it, you would think you're looking at a biography of Curly-Joe! The most insignificant stooge of all is the highlight of the book. To ignore Curly, the king of the stooges, is a shame.",0

"I'm a purple belt in bjj, and I'm sorry but this video is really bad. Yes, it has a lot of techniques, and it's cheap; but you get what you pay. Moves are rushed, mostly not linked and without any strategic consideration. But the primary problem is that they aren't explained in detail and most of them are actually performed incorrectly.The reason why I don't give this instructional just one star is because not all techniques are bad, although all of them lack important details. In my opinion the performer himself have not mastered the moves, and he shows.On the site (google kibun) you will find a few clips, keep in mind that they are not the worse and judge yourself.",0

"This was probably the first attempt to tell the history of the 1892 Homestead Steel Strike since the books that came out in the 1890s very shortly after the event. It's hard, in part because the basic message of the strike and its outcome was and still is pretty discouraging. I had the feeling Wolff was running out of enthusiasm for the task well before he or I got to the end of the book. I was also disappointed in the map of Homestead, which turned out sketchy and inaccurate when I laid it beside a street map of the town from that time. There were useful materials in the Homestead public library when I looked (after Wolff's book was published) that apparently he didn't look into. I'm guessing better books on the subject have been written since this one came out.",0

"I have to admit that when the title song came out in 1989, I really loved it. I also loved ""When I looked at him"". The entire album,however, does not have the same hooks as the first album.

""It Echoes Every Night"" is also a great song.",0

I started to read it, realized half way through that I was just staring at the pages and none of it was registering, so I put it down.I'm not sure what the point of the book was. The story is beyond boring. The author tries to convey life's lessons thru the eyes of a dying old man. Each chapter starts with some generic axiom like ""Learn to love"" then goes into a bunch of lifeless dialogue where the old man basically tells the author to ""Learn to love""There's nothing interesting or unique about this book.Don't waste your Tuesdays and pass on this book.",0

"It's a rule of thumb that seldom steers you wrong: if a video cover shows the actors, who were obviously photographed at different times, crudely montaged together, the movie is going to stink. And, if that wasn't enough of a clue, carefully examine Ms. Weaver's glamorous head. Doesn't it seem just a bit too large for the sleek body it sits atop?I normally wouldn't lead off my review with such trivia but, sad to say, it's the most interesting thing about this sourball of a comedy. I suppose it's the only game in town if you want to ogle Jennifer Dugs Hewitt's cleavage so if that's your kink, godspeed.(The actresses' commentary on the DVD offers a nice illustration of their personal differences. While Ms. Weaver ponders the Gene Hackman character's resemblance to Malvolio in Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"", Ms. Hewitt rues that her butt looks so large in a certain pair of white slacks.)",0
"We purchased this product for our 4-year-old and she loved it. It unfortunately, didn't hold up well enough for her to enjoy it very long - and it wasn't because she was overly rough or abusive.Leaks developed all along the seams, and there are a lot of seams. So, after about 5 minutes, there would no longer be enough air in the bouncer for her to bounce. We repaired the first few, but then it developed so many leaks we simply couldn't repair them all, and the repairs did not hold. (All the initial repairs were made using the supplied repair materials. These materials covered about 4 repairs total. We had to resort to trying other repair methods after that. Those didn't work much better.)This was a total waste of money - especially since we could have purchased 3-4 regular trampolines for the same price.",0

"This film is overrated. Very, very overrated. I guessed the ""trick ending"" almost as the movie started. The whole damned film hinges on this ""trick ending"". Bad acting, bad plot, almost incomprehensible dialogue, and a lack of buildup to the twist at the end. We are given clues, but the end has no dramatic ""rightness"". It's just an ending, with no brilliance to it.",0
"This film takes 007 and turns him into just another action hero after one of those shady billionaire villains. The lagging plot is saved by some incredible stunt work, but the characters have been ""updated"" so badly are hardly recognizable.

Bring back Connery and Moore...heck, even Lazenby and Dalton!",0

"I bought this album the day it came out and was thuroughly disappointed. I wanted to write a bad review then, but decided to wait a few months and give the album a chance to redeam itself. Well, it's been a few months and I've listened to the album a few more times. If this was the first Tool album, then I think I would give it some praise because Tool's sound is just so unique. However, after listening to Lateralus (a masterpiece), Undertow, Aenima, and Opiate, this album simply doesn't measure up. It sounds like the Lateralus B-sides that never made the cut. Some of the songs have huge potential, but never turn into anything worth remembering. I would expect more from this great band. I don't understand how Tool fans can like this album. Is the ""happy smoke"" clouding your judgement? It is such a let down. Tool are still one of my favorite bands, and Lateralus is still one of the best albums in my collection. if you are still curious about this album, then buy it used.",0

"Not a bad book on the whole. The story is interesting enough, but the author seems to take juvenile spats and revenge way too seriously. A litany of 14 year teenagers conversations (Woah, no way, serious?, cool, etc, etc) is really not that exciting. A real light read.",0
"You people are ridiculous. You call this punk music? I can tell you one thing, they dont play real punk or any real music for that matter on TRL. You are all just following a new trend in which you think it is cool to act hardcore because that is the direction that MTV is taking. I am sick of reading reviews by 12 year olds about albums like this saying how they are truly punk music and its great to get away from Nsync, Britney Spears, etc. You teenie boppers are getting to a point that is unbearable and your insidious comments such as those below are just a reflection of how ignorant you truly are. Perhaps you enjoy this cd, thats fine, but please do not try to tell me and others that this is the ""hardcore"" music that has changed your lives and made you trade in all of your britney spears cds. And please dont be mad at my review, you will like a new group and/or music type by next month anyway.",0
"This book was a sensation when it first appeared in 1980.But then something unexpected (by Thurow at least) happened. Ronald Reagan was elected President and ignited a period of spectacular economic growth, coupled with low inflation and high employment, that lasted through the next two administrations - thus proving Thurow totally wrong!Why do publishers keep reprinting books that have been invalidated by history? Why not allow then to sink silently into the dustbin of failed theories where they belong?As Charlie Chan once said: Theory like mist on eyeglasses. Obscures facts.",0

"We finally decided to go out and spend a few extra bucks for a decent coffee maker and came across this one which had the grinder built in (which seemed like a good idea). At first glance the unit looks sharp (hence the 1 star) and we were looking forward to using our new toy. Here is what we found after our first week of use:1) Grinder sounds like a contractor in your kitchen sawing your kitchen table in half...yes..its that loud!2) Ok..so why do we buy coffee makers? For good coffee right? Well this brewed ""coffee flavored"" water. It was nasty and we even threw in an extra helping of beans than the recommended amount...WEAK!!!3) Now what? Yup..you have to break down the whole thing and clean it out...including the nasty slick sludge that accumulates in the grinding station.

Before they announced the launch the price was stated as being between $299 and $399. Now why hasnt the Dept of Justice stepped in to stop this incredible over pricing, do they take us the consumer for idiots?

"Genius would require more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has crossed the line. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off. But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression.",0
"To me, the Brothers Grimm's stories are always too grim (pun intended) for children, even for adults. They lack the fine taste and originality in Andersen's tales. Still, they're classics, so I bought this CD set along with the Andersen 2CD set, also from Naxos, for my kids.While this set has the recording volume right, the voice actress is unfortunately quite colorless and boring, making the grim stories even grimmer. My kids don't like these audio stories, and I don't blame them. So we haven't listened to these again since we bought them nearly 3 years ago.Get the Andersen CD set, even though the recording volume on that set leaves much to be desired.",0

After reading a bit of the bio, I put the book down and returned it back to the library where I got it. The information listed in there was wrong.

"Erskine Caldwell's novel on Russian partisans behind German lines during World War Too is a simplistic book written at about a sixth grade level. Published in 1942, in light of history, it is a one sided view of the war between Germany and Russia. The Germans are evil and commit atrocities against the peasants, which was true, but the fact that the Russians were equally as brutal is not in evidence. Other than as a historical novelty, there is no reason to read this book. I finished it, because it was a short quick read, but would have missed nothing if I had not felt compelled to finish what I started.",0

"I think American remakes of Asian horror movies more often than not are ineffective. THE ECHO is another example. While I haven't seen the original, THE ECHO doesn't inspire me to do so.The movie's basic premise is revenge and the consequences of non-responsiveness to people in peril. This is confusing because some of the victims don't truly deserve to be punished. THE ECHO is also very slow in its pacing and I've grown weary of all Asian remakes having little girl spooks. Jesse Bradford's performance has its moments but eventually fizzles. Amelia Warner is effective as Bradford's supportive girl friend and Kevin Durand is chilling as the abusive cop who abuses his wife and daughter.THE ECHO is to be commended for its atmospheric setting and its moral message, muddled though it is. Its abrupt ending is also a drawback. Ultimately, it's an average entry in a tired genre.",0

"This movie had the potential to be really, really good.. but the director failed to deliver. Whoever wrote the script needs to kick themselves in the nuts. Honestly. I think people like this just because of the big names associated with it, but I really feel like this was a big flop. For one thing, *spoilers* I feel as though the ending was ridiculous. Nearly everyone dies within a 5 minute period. It felt like they kind of just went, ""well.. this movie is getting too long so lets just kill everyone off to wrap it up"". This is the first movie I have ever walked out on. Awful! I hated it.",0
"The other two reviewers here give high praise to this recording. If its the only version of these two works you have heard I can understand why, but having heard numerous versions of these works both recorded and live I must say that these renditions are not at the level I am used to. One would think that with the Chicago Symphony at his disposal Abbado would let loose a little more, but instead of a blazing interpretation we get a rather tame, definetly non-Mahlerian piece of hash. Abbado never really lets the brass shine the way they could and the recording quality is sub-par for DG. As for the recording of the fourth symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic, I was even more dissapointed than with the Ressurection symphony. Very dull sounding and lacking a lot of character found in other renditions. All in all not an invalid interpretation of these two works, but you can certainly do A LOT better than this.",0

Pathetic The Entertainer is proof that you cant fix stupid. The movie about an average guy who thinks he is a spy is so stupid its shameful. There is probably one scene where he does this funny dance and thats it. The rest of this movie is chittlin circuit comedy at its worst. Pathetic the Entertainer is about as funny as the psychos who defend this clown with blind fanaticism. He is a comic not an icon so get a hold of yourselves and see this minstrel clown for the punk sellout he is and not the role model you want him to be! STOP SUPPORTING MINSTREL THEATRE!,0
"This is my least favorite Brian Wilson solo cd. It just comes across very flat with no real energy. The only highlight is Eric Clapton on ""City Blues"". ""Soul Searchin"" may have been a nice idea but lifting Carl's Wilson's voice just does not work. I was looking forward to hearing the collaboration between Brian and Paul McCartney. ""A Friend like You"" is a very ordinary song and McCartney should have been used more. Also, the few seconds you hear McCartney it is obvious that Paul's voice has aged better. Finally, Brian is one of the greats and I am glad he is still creating music. It is just that this is not one of his better efforts.",0
"Sorry, I read the high ratings but the movie lacked interest, action and empathy. It was slow boring and lacked the spark that made you want to see what was coming up next. How can so many people be wrong, it must be me. I suggest you RENT BUT DON'T BUY",0

"I was given the 12 cup BonJour coffee press as a gift.Once my wife, (non coffee drinker) made sure that nothing was broken, she disposed of the packaging. When I completed my out of town work and was ready to try the coffee press, I found that the filter screen etc. would simply not slide down when the plunger was pressed.Since it was a gift I did not have the receipt or packaging I called the company to check for replacement parts or parts breakdown to see what was missing fully expecting to pay for the missing part. I was told that they do not have parts for sale. I would need to buy a completely new item to get the one missing part.I think this comes under the buyer beware category.",0
The actual metal plate that mates with the back of the chassis was much too long for my case (Silverstone TJ08-E). I had to do major surgery and mate it with another PCI slot cover to get it to fit in the slot. So far it is working now that it is mounted. If it had fit in my case without modification I would have given it five stars.,0
Very dull. Was unable to connect with any of the characters in this story. Did not find the plot to be very creative.,0

"I have mixed feelings about this book. I expected more design details such as section views, construction details, mechanisms, installation details, venneer application details and so on. I was left disappointed. However, this book is a good source of ideas on the artistic design aspect of aircraft interiors. I wished it could have been more than just a load of pictures.",0
"I did not manage to get to the end of this book, I got bored way before. It is hard to feel any sympathy for the characters, especially Taita, the narrator. Too many qualities in a single person, there is nothing he cannot do and spends too much time explaining the customs of ancient Egypt to the readers of the 20th century.",0
"I bought this book thinking it would provide pointers on how to handel specific, everyday, and even ""ordinary"" situations assistants encounter with their bosses, and others in the workplace. Pointers that when carried out correctly would prove that you indeed are a ""take charge assistant"".Instead, this book focuses on getting on your bosses good side, which is great, if all you want to be known for is being the dependable ""worker"". I was expecting somethig way more contrete, This book was too wishy-wasy for me.I give it one star because eventhiugh I don't think it specifically states it there is an underlying message of the importance of communication.",0
"I thought it was a step up from another option. Very basic. Works, but not well. Some stuff we planted wasn't detected. Pretty cheap construction as well. Hopefully the kid will get some fun out of it before it breaks or is tossed aside.",0
"Pretty horrible book. Agree with most of the reviewers, unanimously. Authors must have been in one of those ""low quality"" outsourcing shops. Although, probably out of context, authors and the publishing house should take a look at [...], for a classic example of how a technical book should be written especially it is claiming to cover ""real life"" projects.",0
"Aughh! Have you noticed that everyone had to read this book for an assignment in 8th grade, i had to read it in sixth! Want my opinion? This book couldn't be worse; don't even use it as a doorstop; it'll scare away your visitors. I agree with the other ""pearl haters"" anyone who reads this must be fully caught up with their sleep not to drowse off. I had to listen to it aloud and, i'm not kidding, i fell asleep!! No kidding! Okay, okay, 'nuff said. Just that DO NOT GET THE BOOK UNLESS YOU NEED FIREWOOD! Got it? Okay, if i see another person buy this book, i know the world has problems.",0
"I loved the book, it had so many twists and turns. Then I watched the movie and it didn't follow the book at ALL. They didn't even put some of the main characters in the movie. Things just didn't line up. If I never read the book I might have liked the movie, but from the stand point of someone who thinks that a movie should follow the book as close as possible, this movie was a huge disappointment.",0
"I have the 5 qt bowl and bought this set for my sister that has the smaller bowl. The bigger ones fit mine perfect, but they were too small for hers. The smaller size certainly didn't work for her smaller bowl as good as the bigger one did for my bowl.",0
"After reading Rowling's Harry Potter and Chabon's Cavalier and Clay, I eagerly awaited Summerland. Boy, was I disappointed. This overlong, show-offy and tension-free barge of a book was just, plain dull. Wanting to write a children's book and actually doing it well are two vastly different things.This is the literary equivalent of Bill Buckner's play at first base in the sixth game of the '86 World Series. I hope Chabon learns from his error and goes back to writing for adults, which he does fabulously well.",0
"Here is the content summary: Nothing, followed by nothing followed by 2 pages of a set up scenes to make us buy the next book. Read the cover in the local library and assume you can safely wait for book 9.",0
"I love almost everything written by Georgette Heyer. And this book is one of the reasons why I say ""almost""...This book is more of a Gothic-style romance, but even considering that, I found it a creepy and unpleasant read. And if you are looking for a romance novel, there is very little focus on the romance and more on the weird goings-on of possibly deranged family members.I would steer clear of this one! She has so many other great novels, don't waste your time here.I'd give it a one-star, but I just can't do that to a Heyer novel.",0
The delivered item is a cheap knockoff and not BonJour brand. The plunger is not tight on the glass and leaks grounds over the side. The pictures show the BonJour branding on the glass. The product that arrived had a sticker on the box that said it was BonJour Monet but the glass was not branded. I own one of the BonJour branded one and the one that arrived was clearly not the same product as advertised.,0
"It is my opinion that this is hands down, the worst trash I have every viewed in my life.It appears the current owners of this series have casually decided that the star trek franchise was somehow inadequate.In an instant the entire series has been rewritten, and for what; the sake of profits and commerce?The haphazard way in which the characters are throw together absolutely disgusts and sickens me.Clearly no thought has been given to the foundations of this franchise.To me, there is no more vivid example of greed and capitalism run amok; than this ""film"".I will never buy another star trek item of any type for so long as I live, nor will I go to see any future star trek anything.Something wondrous has been taken and turned it into a mere product exactly like all the other action/adventure garbage clogging up the theaters these days.I encourage everyone who reads this review to boycott this movie and anything to do with this franchise.",0

"SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! I have three c310x's and like them alot but was getting tired of waiting on the ""supposedly"" spring map updates. Thought I'd try the c220 or c520 but finances dictated the c220. It was a little more accurate than my c310x but Holy Cow.... you could hardly see the screen or hear the voice prompts. The reviews at the CNET website chew it to pieces. I am in awe of the people who say this a great unit. If they ever update the maps of the c310x, it may be the best MIO ever gets. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT AT CIRCUIT CITY!!! They wanted to charge me a $30 restocking fee for a crummy unit. The best they would do is set me up with another crummy unit. I got another c310x, walked away and kicked the dust of my shoes.",0
"(The rating should actually be 2.5 stars.) After reading some of the glowing customer reviews of this movie, I wonder if I don't remember it as clearly as I thought. I watched this with my mom, and both of us thought the script and direction weren't up to par. Both seemed forced--the dialogue didn't flow very well, and didn't sound easy and natural. The music also really bothered me--a lot of the time it was overly emotional and melodramatic, and reminded me of soap opera music. However, there are redeeming aspects--the three leads. Jeanne Moreau, Claire Danes, and Jude Law are all very talented, and all manage to do respectable jobs. Danes has good chemistry with both Moreau and Law, and that shines through the often bumbling lines. So I didn't hate it, and it wasn't unbearable--obviously some people loved it. If you really like any of the main actors, and the story sounds interesting, go ahead and give it a whirl. Just don't expect too much.",0
"Cuisinart seems to be making defective popcorn makers. My first one died, I had it replaced and then the second one died. Cuisinart products don't seem to have the level of quality they used to. Don't waste your money.",0
"It must be a terrible burden to travel while being weighed down by the burden of plenty, openly disdaining one's own home life while glorifying anything that is different. I really wanted to like this book. As an avid traveller and travellogue reader, I was interested in the outlook of the ADD generation. It is a wonder to check off so many names without actually noticing the places you rip through and deriding those who actually take the time to absorb another culture. I hope Parmar's sensibilities mature in time to actually notice where he travels even to the point where he can at least assemble a small list of favorite places instead of relying upon snarky answers.Granted, there are some interesting parts of this book. These occur when the travelers back off the hammer and actually try to see and experience an area. All he seems to have now is an extensive list of places as flat as the sheet of paper they are written upon.",0
"First it took over a week to receive the product after it was shipped. It has now been three weeks and I don't see any difference in the control of fleas on my dog. I followed the directions in the package (it was not rocket science) and nothing happened. I have also had to continue to use flea spray when I see fleas, to try to control them. I checked the Frontline website for suggestions on what to do. The little questionnaire indicated the problem was probably the dog's environment. If the environment did not have fleas to start with, I wouldn't need Frontline. Therefore, I find this product a waste of money.",0
"I bought the Rowenta professional ironing board, which came with this cover. After about 1 year of use, I washed the cover in cold water and let it air dry. Even with these washing/drying conditions, the cover shrunk appreciably, and would no longer fit on the ironing board.",0
"Ever since I read ""A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver"" when I was about 11, Eleanor of Aquitaine has been my most favoritest historical figure. So I was intrigued when I heard about this book. But it was the MOST BORING history book I have read. I don't know how Allison Weir managed to write such a boring book about such a fascinating person, but she did. I realize that there is not much historical documentation about Eleanor, but this book did nothing for me. What a disappointment!",0
"I generally enjoy a good dirty joke, and I'd heard that this movie was hilarious. I'm not easily shocked, and offensive material doesn't really bother me. The problem is that this movie simply isn't funny. Even poop jokes get old after you've heard the same one 10 times in a row. Maybe people like me ""just don't get it"" because we're not smart (or funny or creative or open-minded or edgy) enough. I say, don't waste your money, unless you have teenage boys in the house. THEY might appreciate the humor, since they're young and haven't already been overexposed to bad standup routines.",0
"I bought a pool from you a few years ago ,that was the best !! you stop carrying that one!! I bought this one at the end of the season it was a good deal I thought !! Did not use until Memorial Day there was a hole in the crease ,so I said okay I will buy some pool patches from you and fix the problem !!patches did not work either !! I just wanted to get one season out of the Pool !! after patching the pool twice and it still did not hold air !! had to pump the pool up every hour for the 4th of July !!this is a bad product !!I still have the other pool on my wish list maybe some day you will get them in again !!those were the coolest pools !!I can not return this one I took scissors to it in anger an threw it out !!",0
"I am a DMX fan, but I want to be honest with you. This is only an ok recording. The whole way through it sounds like it was rushed through production. It just doesn't sound complete. It also has to much of a pop, mainstream feel. I mean I think it was meant to click with the TRL fans or something. I think DMX is just trying to ride out his success with less than average music.If you are a DMX fan, I would suggest this cd because its got his famous style. If your not a real big DMX fan I would suggest that you get the new 2pac instead if your looking for some good rap music.",0
"Buy one Godsmack album. All the Godsmack you need is in your hands now. Get the point?Every song, every note, every word, every theme, pretty much everything is the same. They aren't a bad band, but this album isn't any more creative then Awake or the Self-Titled one. I just went to see Godsmack in concert, and I could have left after one song and still gotten the concert's heat. So overall, if you like Godsmack, don't expect anything new with this album.",0

"Only order these if you live in a colder state or during the colder months of the year. Amazon does not properly package these gummies. I received my first order and it was completely melted. I contacted Amazon about the order, told them about the packaging issue, they promptly sent me a replacement overnight. The only problem is, they still didn't package it any differently and that one was melted too. I finally gave up and requested a refund. Maybe I'll try again when the weather is cooler.",0
"While there exists little in Chinese history that is not thoroughly fascinating, Sterling Seagrave manages to tirelessly and in great detail, unsubstantiate every myth surrounding the last empress of China. She no longer maintains any sort of mystique, as it has been entirely laid bare by someone who is too intent on debunking the half-truths presented by the Europeans. Previous reviews that state that the book lacks of biographical element have it right, with as much pomp and circumstance as possible, the author seeks to prove his postion as a self-proclaimed ""expert"" rather than relaying the story of what could have been a truly fascinating woman.",0
"I have to admit that when I first heard this album as a high-school student, I was captivated by how horrible it was. My friends and I would listen to it repeatedly, almost to the point of cult-worship. We then sought out other Velvet Underground albums, hoping for a similar ""so bad it's good"" experience - but alas, none of the band's other releases, bereft of musicianship or good lyrics though they were, could compare with ""White Light White Heat."" Everything just came together magnificently on this one - the writing, the playing, the singing, the engineering, even the famous ""skull cover""... It all adds up to a classic!I don't want to spoil the music by analyzing it too much, but let me point out Sterling Morrison's lead guitar on ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" as a ""highlight"" of this special collection.",0

"Although the shorts seem to be of good quality, the sizing chart is WRONG!! My petite daughter is 2 1/2 inches smaller than the XS and the XS we received are too small for her.

If I had to do over, I would not have purchased.",0

"Disregard all other reveiws except this one! This book is a total stretch! You are led to believe one killer did it, then another, then you found out it is the same person you started with! I was terribly dissapointed at the ending. What guy in his right mind would plant evidence on himself/herself to throw suspicion to someone else. This book is not worthy of your time, it is not worthy of your money, to say the honest truth this book is not worthy of the sugar-coated review I'm giving it now! Don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want a good, suspenceful read, try TRUTH OR DARE. You won't be able to put it down and it is much less amature than this book.",0
It was hard to picture the characters as well as the scenes despite the author's overuse of adjectives and adverbs. For example The dialogue between the main characters gave me a picture of modern day teenagers. The main character was so annoyingly weak that I did not care what happened to him at the end of this 'unnecessarily made long' story. This author has not convinced me to look forward to reading any other books written by her.,0

"No one who sells this watch services it, for good reason: replacing the battery in Casio calculator/database watches destroys them.

I'll purchase a Timex calculator watch next time, but I prefer the look and style of Casio.",0
"On its own this would seem like a bizarre-sounding Symphonie Fantastqiue. The orchestra is scrawny, the strings scratchy and without vibrato, giving them an irritating zing, the winds thin and not always in tune. But of course this is period performance, which means that nobody has to be up to professional standards.Norrington is a rushed, unbending conductor of this music, as he is of most music, and although it is weirdly fascinating to hear such Berliozian oddities as the ophicleide in the orchestra (a blatty coiled metal kind of bassoon), the overall musicality isn't there. Those who like period performances would naturally disagree by a mile.",0

"I watched this film at an anime festival and was not impressed. I usually enjoy space adventures, but this was lame. I was really turned offed my the lead character who seemed like a such a male chauvanist and there were entirely too many bikini wearing alien women. The plot was slow and confusing at times. It reminded me too much of Heavy Metal (which was lame too). I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on it. I thought it was a waste of time at the festival.",0
"Staind really isnt that good to begin with, tho i amtold that they are pretty good live, but this albumBreak The Cycle by no means even influences me to gosee them live.As for this record Break The Cycle, all it hasare the hits, as well as the songs that werepromoted. Like Its been a while, epiphany,Take it,For You, Outside and Fade.

"Got this stapler as gift, straight out of the box it didn't work. Never got around to returning it, so one day I messed with it for a while and got it to shoot 2 or 3 staples, thought all was good and put it on the shelf. Went to use it yesterday and managed to shoot 4 staples before it broke again, opening the cartridge reveals that it keeps splitting up the staples causing them to misfire and even sometimes jam. I gave up after reloading it about 5 times and only successfully shooting 6-8 out of 40-50 attempts.The only place this thing belongs is in the garbage!!",0

Even in the Manufacture's Information it states that it can be used with an adjustable Kettrike frame, one that separates in two. Well the Air Happy Kettrike separates in two and it does not fit. I'm sure, having the correct bike would make this item a 5 star toy. I guess not being able to return it because my 30 days are up has soured the situation. Good luck and be sure you purchase the correct bike.",0
"An interesting idea although not very well presented. This book is more like the second or third draft of a possibly good book, both in substance and style.

"I was waiting anxiously for this movie to be released and I am now wondering why. This was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years. It is a mish-mosh of totally irrelevant scenarios and I, being a fan of horror for years, lost interest in the first fifteen minutes. If you enjoy the game, do not purchase this film. I have a feeling that we should expect to see Resident Evil 2 on the horizon, due to the ending. Please don't bother.",0
"I think charges could be brought against Alessandra for this offering. He banks heavily on the statistical knowledge that very few people who buy this kind of book ever read beyond the second chapter. Therefore, the first two chapters and the cover are merely razzle-dazzle fluff constantly mentioning ""charisma,"" but rarely saying much about it. He then offers a weak thesis that charisma is related to communication then proceeds to stuff the rest of the book with what is obviously old material on the subject of communication occasionally tying it to charisma. This ""filler"" material, I will say, is solid stuff, but, overall, this book, as well as Mr. Alessandra, are very disappointing.",0

"What a waste of a reader's time! Friends for umpteen years, these women still rely on ""traditions"" established when they were pre-teens? I don't think so. I cannot possibly imagine any group of middle aged women who will cite certain ""rules"" (referred to as ""traditions"" in their jargon) throughout conversations. Who keeps track of such nonsense? The characters might have had substance, but the constant back tracking to the days of yore (teendom) led to days of yawn by yours truly. And in the end, they all lived happily ever after--if not with a man, then with his fortune. Just ducky. Just avoid it. Trust me.",0

"Folks, unless you live in one of the very few windy locations and most of those places are rural, what good is a wind turbin for $2,000+?I can charge batteries for pennies, charge my shaver, my boat and RV batteries with utility power at 12 cents per kwh. Also, consume 120 or 240 power for the same cost.

"I knew I was going to be disappointed when I saw the picture on the back of the case. Crow looks way to clean shaven. I was used to seeing the long haired lanky man reigning over his drum set. This is a big difference compared to the power of Safari's cover. Just like the picture, this is a much tamer version of the flat duo jets. The songs just don't have the same energy as the earlier material. And the many instruments and overdubs also detract from the overall quality. It is still a decent record, but far from the jet's best work. The raw edge which initially drew me to love Dex and Crow is completely gone here.",0

"I have just bought this new canon NP-E3, at the first glance I was so disappointed, it's made in CHINA, unlike the original one supplied with camera was made in Japan. I have not been trying to shoot to see how long does it last yet but if you think there is no different between the products made in Japan and China then you were totally wrong. I call Canon sale support and ask for this information, they've told me as what they see it supposed to be made in Japan. To be confirmed more information about this battery, I called Canon dealer BHphotovideo and Sammy's camera and ask for this. Guess what! They said made in CHINA. What a shame on Canon new generation. I hat off to you.",0
"This is one of those films that misses the ""classic"" category by a fair bit, and really is for Pal completists only. The science and humor has dated pretty badly, and the FX are pretty funny. The blue-screening on the space wheel makes it somewhat transparent along its bottom circumference. I can't believe no one noticed this, therefore I have to conclude that they let it go hoping no one would notice. Well, that hope is in vain. I can't say much for the acting, either. Still, it's a relatively painless way to spend an hour or so, and has undeniable historical significance in the ranks of sf film. I had remembered this film as being better than it actually is. Of course, the last time I saw it I was about 13 years old, and that was more than 40 years ago. Other films of the era have dated, as well, but they're lots more fun to watch.

"couldn't he just have waited a while let's say like july 1999. The songs that are truly his are great no doubt, but the mixes, they might not be terrible but they aren't great either. And why do his singles always have those stupid remixes anyway. You buy a single and find a hundred other remixes which all are the same except from one computerized percussion somewhere in the background. May god save you if your a fan of this guy, you feel obliged to buy everything but what do you get, only remixes. Like with the 5 different existing versions of stranger in moscow. five times the same song and 30 remixes. now wow, that's just what i wanted, NOT!!!!! You got the same deal with all those r&b singles, always remixes and remixes, f*%$#k those mixes, thank god for the creativity of the so called rock and alternative music, at least they throw some real b-sides on their singles.",0
"Unlike other books by Ms. Rice, I found Taltos to be tedious, ponderous, dull, and in need of editing for both content and context, not to mention grammar. Come on, I stayed up late to finish a book that fell completely flat.Ridiculous, rushed ending. Don't waste your time on this one.",0

"This is not the best written book. I am learning a lot of stuff about FrontPage 2002, but I while reading the book I get the filling that it was by more than one person. Sometimes the 1st person is used, sometimes it is not. The steps in the books are not always clear and are overly wordy. Some of the steps seem to over explain process that had already be explain earlier, almost as if the author did not realize he had already explain them. You can learn with this book, but unless you're buying it at a very discounted price, by some other book.",0
"I purchased the Hunter #44110 from Lowes hardware May 1, 2007. The first control, which was replaced within weeks, did not hold the temperature set for a given period. In other words, if set to AC to come on at 80, the reading could be much highter without it having turned the AC on. Same for the heat. If set to say 76, the reading could be much lower without it having turned the heat on. Didn't experience this problem through testing the setting with the second Hunter right away but now the same situation is being experienced. I do not recommend this particular control module by model number.",0

"What a shame. Nick Hornby does so well when writing about subjects he knows about. Here, however, he tries to break the formula and write about something different - and it all goes horribly, horribly wrong. The story... well, just isn't a story, simply one idea stretched beyond breaking point. The characters are cartoon-like, and in the end it just doesn't work. Read anything else by this brilliant author, but avoid this stinker.",0
"I saw the Broadway show several times and loved it. The movie is overblown and is not faithful to the original Broadway production. The dancing is great, Michel Douglas' performance is way over the top and the singing is fair at best. What a disapointment. Attenborough should have remained faithful to the original script and characterizations.",0
"I have read all of Cornwell's books, and have enjoyed them. I feel that she was trying to hard to be clever. The Marino has a hard on for Kay story line is a bit over done, the Lucy is loosing it is also over done. The entire book dragged till the last chapter, then it was just over. Done. I was left feeling that I wasted my time reading this book. She had lost her touch!",0
This movie is boring and stupid. Don't buy this DVD or rent the movie. I can tell you right here everything that happens in the movie so save your money. Bill Murray goes to Japan to film a commercial for a local whiskey. He is bored and meets the wife of a photographer who is also bored. They go together to a few stupid places and develop some platonic relationship. In the end he leaves to the U.S. and she stays in Japan. The end. Sucks huh? I can only say that this movie was done becuse of the Coppola name behind it. If some unknown would have written this junk they would have been laughed at.,0
I think this is a boring story ... 400+ pages about a lady tight up in a bed? I think he could have written the same story in 40 pages max ... I guess you could say that the author does an amazing job writing a whole novel about one lady in one room ... But why should the author and the reader be handicapped like that? ... What is it some kind of writing excerise? ... Anybody else writes this book and it never gets published,0

"I was very excited about purchasing this DVD until I read that it was colorized and ""pan and scan"" (i.e., not the original theatrical aspect ratio).

"""A Caress..."" focuses more on Princess Meredith and her harem's relationships. The big bad thing doesn't come into play until about the middle of the book. Its defeat was anticlimatic.The book in general seems to set things up for the third book. I hope Ms Hamilton takes a break so that she can provide a fresh and suspenseful story in the third installment. Because ""Caress"" wasn't it. At the end of ""A Kiss"" I wanted to know what happens next - even though I feel Princess Meredith is just a revised version of the Anita Blake character from Hamilton's Vampire Hunter Series. However, at the end of ""Caress"" - I can't say that I care what happens.I'll keep my fingers crossed and wait very patiently (and hope it pays off) for the next book.",0

"This is the worst book ever. Definitions and concepts are ambiguous, incosistent and sloopy.

"OMG - Barrayar is literally the worst book I've ever read. Halfway through Shards of Honor, I suspected the author was a woman. Halfway through Barrayar, I was convinced the author was a sexist man writing what he thought would be a woman's perspective. I mean, if I were to write a book mocking the 'stereotypical woman,' I would basically write Barrayar. The protagonist sits in a house all day long every day and really only gets involved in the exciting events of the outside world by going from room to room asking the actual participants how they are feeling. When not playing therapist, she spends her time waxing maternal, playing matchmaker, and noticing her husband's flashing eyes. I'm not making this up.I'm on book 7 of the Vorkosigan Saga. It has its ups and its downs, this is definitely a down. Unfortunately, it's basically required reading for the next book.",0
This is not even in the same categorie as Iris depeche mode etc. This is euro dance crap.

By preventing access to TTS, the publisher has denied my blind husband the opportunity to read this book on his Kindle through text-to-speech as he wants to do.

"I bought this for my son with visions of t-ball in the backyard, lemonade, good ol summertime fun. Well, that didn't happen. The Balls are too heavy, pitching feature pitched it like 3 inches so unless your child is a Thumballina twin forget that. The batteries lasted as long as it took to take it outside, get really frustrated, and go back in. Really. My son did use the t-ball stand. Once. It's too low for him. So if you ant a t-ball stand for young young child its ok. But the pitching feature and balls theselves are a waste. All in all, just save some dough and get a 5 doller t-ball stand. If you need it to pitch get something else alltogether.",0

"As a man, I find this theory offensive. The author seems to think that either of her two modes of marital practice--bitchy control freak [former] and submissive doormat [now] are the only two states married couples can function in. How about leaving the realm of the dysfunctional and try a healthier approach--mutual respect? A man who can recognize that the woman he married is intelligent, might know directions better than he, or has some expertise in finance or raising children, is not a man, he's a EUNUCH pretending to be a man. On behalf of my wife, a brilliant, funny, secure and loving woman with whom I am privileged to share life, I'd like to say BAH!

"Funakoshi wrote this book near the end of his life, after America had bombed his karate dojo into the dust, after his son died, and after his wife died. His home in Okinawa was destroyed, and his people lived under the military rule of the United States. He expresses pacifism and the usual talent for exaggeration one finds in an old martial artist.

"I would only recommend this book to people who want an easy read. This is because it was boring, every page was the same and there was little excitement. You always knew what was going to happen next, the author's way of writing was very plain and there was little detail. Every chapter was about living in hiding and how bored they got. Once in awhile something exciting happened, like the German soldiers came to the house. It was hard to concentrate because I didn't find the book interesting. Also, I didn't find any connections to the characters. They were both older. Also, I have never hid with my life on the line. I would recommend this book to people looking for something easy to ready, with little excitement.",0

"This clamp-on air chuck is solidly constructed of quality materials, but I think it must be poorly designed for the following reason. It is easy to push it onto a schrader valve too far so the lever won't lock in the up position, and you risk damaging the schrader valve if you try to force it. It is also easy to not push it on far enough so you don't get air into the tire. What is not easy is attaching it ""just right"" so it works. The sweet spot between these two extremes is so narrow that I hit it in only 1 out of 10 tries. From now on I am using a screw-on air chuck (as on Lezyne pumps) and have found them to be much much less hassle. ToPeak makes good pumps, I just wish they made a screw-on air chuck.",0

Second company through amazon required me to pay postage to return. Too bad, for the computer challeged this was a nice alternative, but quality control sucks with this company.",0
"Having owned a Kodak 4Mp camera, we wanted to step up to a better lens and more zoom, so we bought a Z2. Although the pictures are good if everything is correctly set, this is a fairly rare coincidence. It took us quite a while to figure out that you must manually lift up the flash. We lost and still lose many pictures because we forget to do this. Also, this is not a camera that can be easily slipped into a pocket or purse. The 10x lens makes it bulky, and does not fully retract even when off. Because of these two things we have essentially abandoned this new Z2 in favor of our old Kodak. If you are looking for a point and shoot, to capture family moments and events, then this is not the camera for you.",0

It is to be hoped that his next book will return faith to his followers.",0
"This was the first investment book I bought a few years back. The fundamental sections, regarding earnings growth is OK. The technical analysis sections are extremley un-clear, and poorly written. For example, he often talks about bases and recommends not buying a stock that is 5% above its base. The problem is he never really defines what constitutes a base. There are many more similar problems, and I promise that you will end up doing a lot of assuming. By the time you are done reading this book, you will have more questions than answers. Not a good way to build up confidence. If you are new to investing, you would be much better off buying a Motley Fool, book. If you are not new, and have already read several other books, I doubt you'll take anything worthwhile from this one.",0

We own 3 Britax car seats and this was our first purchase outside of Britax and I regret it. The seat belt on this vehicle also is one piece, which means that it gets lopsided and you have to pull on one side to try to get the top even. I will spend the money on Britax from now on. When you try to move a Britax after it's installed your vehicle will shake rather than the car seat. Nothing compares.",0
"I must give the author two stars for effort, as Frasier is a very eloquent writer, however, I did not enjoy the story in the least bit.

I would definitely avoid this book, unless you want something that will put you to sleep as a result of a lack of any action. Maybe that is why all so many people liked Cold Mountain...it is a good alternative to sleeping pills.",0

The unit is no longer making hot coffe and requires a kick in the pants with the microwave. I have emailed Farberware for a return - Again. We will see where it leads...The only reason I am giving 2-stars is that there was no hassle with the warranty. A pre-paid shipping label was provided and a new pot is on the way.

Probably better - as I have always found it kind'a convoluted the key sequence you enter to set the brew time on the Farberware unit.",0

It would make Freddy or Jason flinch!",0
I am very disappointed in the Cannon i960 printer. The printer head is very poorly designed. I had great difficulty getting the print head and ink cartridges to work. I had to reseat the printer head 5 times before it would work. I had to reseat the magenta ink cartridge 5 times before it would work. It took 4 hours of reading the manual to diagnose all the errors I was getting and running tests to get this printer where it would print a color picture. Our last printer was an HP 895cse. The HP was easy to set up and ran great for 3 years. I wish we had bought another HP. I am very disappointed in the quality of this printer.,0

"As one listens to the first few tracks of Nimbus Luna's ""Car Window,"" it becomes painfully apparent that NL are kind of a one-trick pony. Not that that in itself is bad, but their one trick isn't really that impressive to begin with. Sure, the Long Beach natives offer a generous blend of pop and rock set to singer Ron Legaspi's romantic lyrics, but as the record goes on, one has to check their cd player to make sure that the ""repeat one track"" button was not accidentally depressed on account of the songs sounding so similar. You might enjoy NL if you like Vertical Horizon or Lifehouse sans the heavy guitars.",0

Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable",0

I found myself asking 'was Fisher in love with himself?' A boring, mostly fruitless read, offering insight only into Fisher's secret surprise at his own economic self sufficiency.",0

The book touches on various concepts and extreme practices, like shaping-corsetry and branding, but in a glossed over manner.Read it so you can say you read it, and then go read one of my own books to read something far more engaging, detailed and realistic.PEEPER (Gethis: History of a Planet)The Healer (Gethis: History of a Planet)",0
"This is the fictional version of Jones' Tough Guide to Fantasyland. I enjoyed that book. Not this one, though. It is over 500 pages of sadism which, apparently, is supposed to be funny. It is not.I absolutely would not allow a child to read it and I would be suspicious of any adult who enjoyed it.",0
"AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.Stiff Upper Lip~ AC/DC : 2 stars",0

So far, I have opened 2 out of the 5 boxes and more than half of the cereal is crushed and not edible (unless you like it that way). I also bought the chocolate Special K cereal and the same problem so I assume it has to do with the shipping.It's a shame because the big bite size is rarely on sale like the small bite kind so I jumped on this price. Considering you are only getting half the cereal it turned out to be a bust.",0
"WHEN FRIDAY THE 13TH WAS RELEASED THE PROBLEM WAS THAT YOUNG KIDS HAVE HAD PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THEIR ANGER. BUT IN 1980, THE HORROR FILM STARTED TO BECOME POPULAR AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE MOVIE. UNLIKE IT'S PRECEDORS THE MOVIE INTRODUCES THE CHARCATERS WITH FUNNY LIKE ANTEDOTES FROM OTHER HORROR MOVIES. CUNNIGHAM WHO DIRECTED THE MOVIE SAID THAT IT WAS A COPY OF HALLOWEEN BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT MOVIE AND IT WAS SOME SORT OF TRIBUTE BUT I TEND TO DISAGREE. WHILE THE MOVIE IS FUN IT IS ALSO INCREIDBLY STUPID AND DUMB. AND WE HARDLY SEE ANYTHING FROM BETSY PALMER(JASON'S MOTHER) UNTIL THE LAST 15 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE YET SHE GETS TOP BILLING. OH, BOY I LIKE IT AND THEN AGAIN I DIDN'T.",0
"Let's face it, the first movie was the best and will never be equalled. The t.v. series was also very good, and I liked it a lot. But this movie was a waste of $6. I don't think the editing could have been any worse, totally choppy, and cut in to the continuity. As far as the acting goes, Adrian Paul looked lost, and Christopher Lambert looked to be in a great deal of pain. (And what ever happened to Paul's character ""laying down the sword"" at the end of the t.v. series?) I would love to see a t.v. movie with Adrian Paul as Highlander, but please no more theatrical releases.",0

"First of all, interested readers should be made aware that this is not the same educational type DARE TO BE GREAT books that are out by great writers like Cameron and Kreuger. You won't find any information in this tome on how to be great at anything.Instead of being educational, this book is about an apparent ripoff company called Dare To Be Great from the 70's. According to author Rudy Maxa, the founder and CEO Glenn W. Turner cheated thousands out of $44 million+ with an apparent illegal pyramid scheme called DARE TO BE GREAT.Judging by the reviews here, Turner apparently had a lot of fans and supporters. In any event, I found this book worthless and not even worth the $1.25 it was selling for at a used book store. The book is small and has no useful content.",0

"Although Jack Reacher is compelling, this book is far from it. The plot is trite and the villains are virtually nonexistent. A dark, shadowy, tough guy, walks in a dusty crooked town run by a rich SOB. Boring. Sounds like every bad Patrick Swayze movie. Of course Reacher falls for the only single girl in town, too, and way too quickly. Child indulges Reacher's fondness for cracking heads, but that was the lone bright spot for me. Otherwise, Killing Floor is a predictable, unoriginal, and disappointing read.",0

I had my 21mo and 7mo in the stroller, so it definately had nothing to do with the weight of the children.

"Just wanted to add some ""me too's"" to the review list. Not that I don't like well written sex scenes, but after the overdose in ""Cerulean Dreams"" I decided not to buy this book but got on the hold list at the local library. Glad I did. Instead of all the sex I would have rather read about Dolph's daughter-in-law-to-be and family dynamics, a fight with Moroven (Damien's maker-at least in this book), Barbara & Steve Brown's murdered son who Barbara is going to have animated come hell or high water, Stephen & Gregory's abusive father confronting his now-were boys, the vampire church's problems with no blood oaths, the problems Micah sorts out with the coalition or springing somebody (or everybody) from a lycanthrope safe house. And, of course, more interesting monsters, human and non-human. I hope LKH is not going to dole out these kind of story lines in miserly doses among pages and pages and pages of sex.",0

"A critical study of the great Hope-Crosby-Lamour Road Movies is long overdue - but this does not even begin to fit the bill.Low on facts and thin on substance, the book seems more like a student's essay than a real study of the films. The author seems content that a quick overview of scenes from each film is enough to comprise an in-depth discussion, and constantly repeats himself, often putting the exact same paragraph within a couple of pages (Who was the proof reader for this book? ....).When the book attempts to be critical (which it rarely does) it falls flat on it's face. The idea that The Road To Hong Kong is the least of the series purely due to it's Space Travel plot, - meaning it is less based in reality than the other films - is totally flawed.To sum up - a potentially great book is scuppered by repetitious prose, little new information or research and very weak arguments. ....Oh well, nice try - hopefully someone will do the series justice one day...",0

"First and foremost, I have been a Stevie Wonder fan for over thirty-five years and I mean a big fan. If someone had asked me in the late Eighties or early Nineties who my all-around favorite musican was, I'd have said Stevie Wonder. Today, Stevie is still fabulous in concert, but over the last 15 years, I find that his studio material has been sliding deeper and deeper into the abyss. I can't say that there were more than one or two cuts on A Time to Love that made me want to listen again. For some musicians, this level of songwriting and performance would be fairly well-received, but for Wonder, it's a sign that his best music may be behind him. It just doesn't move me and if this album took ten years to produce, something is not right in the House of Wonder. Having said all that, Stevie is still one of the greatest musicans of all time and even if he never writes another song, his place in history is guaranteed. He will always symbolize the true spirit of Innervision.",0

Before we moved she slept in her own bed, so we were looking for alternative ways to get her to go to sleep again on her own. This book was a huge disappointment because it made me feel guilty for even trying to get her to sleep in her own bed. This is a very unrealistic approach to night time parenting.",0
"I started this book twice (I stopped to read another book) and after reading about 100 pages, I still don't like it but I think I have a revelation.Most reviews of this book say how ""hilarious"" and ""gut-bustingly"" funny it is. I don't think it's funny at all; I don't think it was intended to be funny. I think the author created a character based on himself and this is how he saw the world. Ignatius seems to have major mental issues and is seriously detached from real life. His behavior isn't comical or quirky, it seems to border on insanity. I don't really understand the appeal of this book filled with unappealing characters.",0
"The Detonator was quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever had the unfortunate oppurtunity to watch. Not to mention the most dullest. The acting was horrible, the dialoge weak, and everyone ran around like a chicken with its head cut off. I found myself rooting for Christpher Lee just to pull the plug, and explode the darn bomb.Nothing went right, and the entire experience made you come away with the feeling that you could have done a better job, had the director merely handed the script over. Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother renting this movie, the time spent over it is definatly not a good way to spend those precious minutes of your life.",0
"Have used the Bodum electric kettle for travel for years, but decided I'd purchase this Proctor Silex for the office since it was a few bucks cheaper. That was a mistake.Despite boiling and dumping out the water a half-dozen times, the water itself STILL tasted like ""plastic."" Ick. As a tea drinker, the quality of the water is key. Also, I found the general shape difficult to handle, the lid was hard to open, and when gently pouring the water it consistently (and dangerously) sloshed out the sides near the spout.Anyway, I ended up giving this one away and buying an additional Bodum electric kettle for the office. It's working great, just like the 10-year-old Bodum I take traveling.

"I guess I am not alone in my great dissatisfaction with the charging capabilities, or lack thereof, with this unit. What is Remington thinking, really? Of what use is a product that seems capable of many good years of service, yet in about a year, can no longer be used without first charging it up every day or two. That it can't be used while plugged in, unless it's already charged, compounds the frustration & annoyance! No matter how long it's charged, even overnight, it will not hold a charge for more than a day, two at the most. And when it's dead, even plugging it in does no good. I doubt Ill ever buy another Remington product again, for even the shaver works well, which this one does, if it can't be used when needed, what's the point?",0

Boris Yeltsin dies after having heart surgery. The next plot developer is a terrorist act that is committed in New York on New Year's Eve. After the terrorist act it is all downhill. The plot dies a sad death. The villains are even boring. I also was able to discover that Roger Gordian is not Jack Ryan. This is not vintage Clancy. The new book ""Bear and the Dragon"" is a much better book. I think he must have fired his ghostwriter. Don't buy this book.",0

To sum it up, I am glad I got it at the library instead of wasting my money. What happened, Patricia Cornwell?!?!?!",0
"Why is it that lesbians are either homicidal maniacs or suicidal neurotics? I know that this movie was made by lesbian director, Lea Pool and I want to support her efforts. However, this movie, besides having an overdone, hackneyed plot, was full of trite and affected dialogue. Ok, so I'm a realist, sue me, but I'm sorry, no one I know would who's in high school would jump on a table in full fencing regalia and recite Shakespearean soliloquy. In the end, heterosexuality wins out and the poor lesbian, being tortured as she is, must put herself out of her misery. I can't recommend this and hope that if you must see it, by all means rent it.

"I studied the first 8 chapters of this book instead of attending the undergraduate lecture. This was a mistake. Tanis & Hoggs present probability and statistics, an otherwise interesting topic, in the most mechanical way imaginable. There is no reference (that I can recall) to any underlying mathematical ideas or questions, nor to the problems which originially prompted Poisson, Bernoulli, Gauss, etc. to inquire about the nature of ""randomness"" in physical events. The authors seem to suppose that their examples demonstrate such things by proxy. This book may make a decent reference for advanced students, but should not be used to teach those seeing prob & stat for the first time... that is, unless, you want it to also be their last.",0
"I want to believe that I have a top of the line entertainment equipment. I guess I don't because the sound quality in this movie was crap. Every time the actors began to speak I had to raise the volume and try to comprehend their english. The whole movie I was rewinding trying make out what they were muttering. But the funniest thing is that every time the actors would stop speaking and the dramatic background music started, it would be so loud that I would turn the sound off. I want to believe that this was a great movie and wonderfully well directed and edited but I can't. I officailly declare this movie the worst...!!!!",0
"This was a B movie and it did not let me down. The only thing shakier than the camera man was the plot.First, let me say that the idea of the movie was pretty good and original but the execution lacked a whole lot. The camera work was horrible with shakiness, times that it was out of focus, background music that comes and goes and does not seem to belong there. The acting was second rate. The story line jumped around. There was absolutely no character building. Overall, this movie was like a train wreck, you don't want to look but can't look away.",0
"Clashing cultural values, inner city troubles, and Clint Eastwood. Sounds great, and it should have been a phenomenal movie.

Too bad.Verdict: Watch the trailer, then skip the movie.",0

"Johnny Tremain is one of the slowest book I've ever read! It has way to many characters (at least half of them the story could do without), that made it not very easy to follow. How t ever won the newbery award, is something i'll never know. I don't think you'll like Johnny Tremain.",0
"I rented this movie expecting so see a laugh-out-loud comedy from the Wayans--this didn't do it for me! The Wayans brothers' FBI job seems a little bit unrealistic, and the voices they use to impersonate the Wilson sisters get pretty annoying by the end. They sound too gabby!There was one part where I laughed when Latrell started singing the Vanessa Carlton song in car...That was my only LOL...If you want to rent a funny movie, don't rent this one. It drains along with not much plot to go on, and tries to have a heartfelt message at the end. Not what I wanted to see.",0
"The author develops his ideal diet based on the scientific evidence that we have the ability to sense various tastes, such as sweet, sour, bitter, etc. So far, so good. He then suggests that our brain has set points for these and if we eat one of the tastes, such as sweet, we have to keep eating this until the set point is satisfied. Maybe. Where this falls apart in my mind is his dietary suggestions, supposedly evolved from the above observations. That is, such things as the peach diet, where the only consistency throughout is the ""peach"" with plenty of other opportunities for sour, bitter, savory set points being initiated. I consider this book largely just another reworking of other dietary books already available, with the slight twist of discussing taste as an issue, but not really following through with that so well.",0

"We bought this baby monitor to hear our toddler daughter call us in the night if she needed us. We had an old Safety that we used for 5 years but as it aged, it became more static-y. My husband wanted one that had a privacy feature so I picked this up. He immediately commented that the 900MHZ frequency really wouldn't give us privacy but would try it out.This baby monitor worked for a few weeks but then the receiver would start to ""pop"" loud static sounds. First it started around 4am in the morning but then progressed into all hours of the night randomly. My husband thought maybe it was picking up wireless or X10 signals... Whatever the reason, these receivers are useless to use at night and will have to be used only during day use for my younger child's naps.",0
"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child follows one of the best in the franchise-The Dream Master, yet this one seems to just lose the credibility the third and fourth ones attempted to make. The idea is kind of hocky, Freddy being to weak to attack Alice, so he attacks her unborn child. The return o Freddy's mother is kind of lame as well. The good acting is gone and the scare factor is non-existant. The one good thing though is the gore factor. There are some good ""original"" death scenes which kind of make the movie worth watching.",0
"I've had great fun with my Geko 301, but it's also been somewhat frustrating. I see that other reviewers have also experienced problems such as no functionality in forests. If you're spending a day walking in a forest, the device is essentially useless. I wish someone had told me that beforehand. I'm in South Africa, incidentally. Worse, my second Geko 301 in a period of three years has just experienced display panel failure.

"This is outdated scholarship that continues to be reprinted because it is trendy and publishers can make money. Raphael Patai is not a ""noted scholar"", but a learned rabbi whose understanding of the topic is based on comparative religion models from the turn of the last century.

"If you enjoyed the Hobbit then you will probably be disappointed with this as the 2nd in the animated series (3 Total). It is over stylized with a mix of animation and live action background and just seems really over-produced because it is the namesake.The HobbitandThe Return of the Kingare consistent and both very entertaining, but unless you are looking to just complete your collection this movie is not really worth the price unless you are buying a WELL USED copy.As a side note, if you have children both the Hobbit and Return of the King are fine for them to watch as tales of morality, but this film is a bit more violent and graphic in its depictions of gore. It also attempts to 'frighten' the audience more with flashes, bangs, and dark characters causing mayhem. Don't know if Orson Bean is still living, but he needs to make a Lord of the Rings film to make up for this mess of a film.",0

So now I have to wait a little while before I finish getting dressed, wipe my armpits with some tissue, and then put a shirt on.

They are all, with their hybrids developed since the 1940's, generally included in the designation ""Louisiana Irises"", with an international society of several hundred members and are included in honors and awards of the American Iris Society.

"I won't bore you with a description of what's wrong with this movie because nothing at all works in it. From the derivative plot to the lame acting to the ridiculous ""twist"" ending, this movie is bad from start to finish. If you like bad movies or just want to torture yourself, then this might be a film for you. OK, it probably isn't the worst movie ever made (in a world with Baby Geniuses, Glitter, and Showgirls how could it be?), but it is God-awful. Renting this film would be a mistake. Just stear clear altogether.",0
"As soon as I started watching, and after realizing it takes place in New York city, which is in OUR world, I knew it would be bad. I was right. It isn't an Anime, let alone Final Fantasy. It's like a computer designed FX movie, which are all pointless and stupid alike. Final Fantasy is one of the greatest Anime series I've ever seen and this is nothing even remotely close. The graphics are probably the most realistic I have ever seen in anything on the planet and look real, but they don't look like the awesome Japanimation I love and that Final Fantasy has. I doubt Squaresoft even oversaw the production of this movie, let alone MADE it, because this is NOT Final Fantasy in any way.Mike Morrison",0

"In no way does this version compare to the A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. The actors, the inferior cinematography, the condensed story, and the lesser costume designs - all sorely disappointed me.

I have no desire to ever watch this film ever again.",0
"Scarpetta was a truly fascinating character in the first book, but in ""Black Notice"", I believe she has become a self-absorbed excuse for a medical examiner-detective. And poor Marino! We knew he had problems and he was a sloppy dresser, etc., but Ms. Cornwell has completely stripped him of any likable traits. Lucy is a niece from Hell. And the storyline - unbelievable! If you don't know what to do with a character, kill her off! Please, Patricia, fire Scarpetta and end it!",0

"I fail to understand all the praise for this book. All of his books make just one basic point ""you should let your money work for you by investing wisely, don't just rely on your salary"". Do you need to read 200 page books to understand this point? There is no practical actionable advice for the novice investor, just oft repeated principles reiterated many times using his rich dad.Another thing that is irritating is the fact that he keeps repeating one and the same thing like going to school is not very useful etc.You wil learn a lot more about investing from other more focused books and websites like motley fool, morning star etc. Don't waste your money on this book.",0
"Buy the book if you want to know how NOT to design a C++ OpenGL classes for Windows. The book makes a big (and common) mistake of integrating OpenGL rendering context management into CView derived object, as if OpenGL could render to CView window only!

Full screen rendering issues are also not covered. You also won't find any WindowsNT specific issues (like rendering to enhanced metafile).",0

"This movie is like a mixture between Citizen Kane and a docudrama on 1970's music and subculture.The glamrock star Brian Slade(!) fakes being murdered on stage, and on the top of his career. Ten years later, a journalist gets the task to find out whatever became of Brian.It's about rock, fame, dreams, ruined youth, homosexuality.Brilliant acting, not least by Ewan McGregor, one of contemporary cinema's greatest talents. Good effects, dream sequences and so on. The story, however, is ""far out""...",1
"This was a really good book. I enjoyed it so much because I know that the girl, Wilma, shares a lot of the same feelings as many other girls. It was also extremely funny and interesting. When Wilma gives up her seat to an old woman, the old woman says that she can grant any wish for Wilma. I won't say much more, but if there were a morale to this story, I would say it is ""be careful what you wish for"". I recomended it to my cousin, and she really liked it also.",1
"This review is for those people in the buying public who, like me, might find this book a bit over-the-top. No offence meant to the book by that, it's intended to be shocking. By very virtue of its topic matter, it is going to be a difficult read at times. It might not be for everyone though, so do remember to read the pages on offer. Apart from that, I have only to mention that the book is paced well, the characterisation isn't perfect, but I have read a lot worse, and it's written quite satisfactorily, with a lot of good plot elements to keep the pages turning.If you like the intro pages, you will like the book.",1
"This is a pretty decent soundtrack, worth checking out. Does anyone though know of any artist/composers that compare more to the slurry/dreamy single stringed tracks like Track 1. I'm looking for a CD that has mostly that style of song.",1
A truly fantastic book but it did take me a while to get into it. After the first 50 or so pages though I couldn't bare to put it down! A book I think which teaches you alot about Japanese culture and how lonely it could be.,1

"It was a pleasant surprise to discover this book. Its description reminded me of Martin Gardner's Fantasia Mathematica and its sequel, The Mathematical Magpie. In fact that is exactly, deliciously, what William Frucht has given us. In an afterward, he tells how he begged Gardner to put together a new mathematical fantasia. Gardner finally suggests that Frucht put it together himself! Gardner's original anthology is one of my favorite anthologies of all time, and Frucht's successor is satisfyingly worthy. Three cheers for Frucht! Now if only there were sequels to the sequels...one sequel in the first square of a giant chessboard, two in the second, four in the third, eight in the fourth...ah, yes...what a beautiful thought, albeit a tad mite greedy...but like Stanislaw Lem's theoretical dragons, maybe the theoretical sequels to the sequels could sometimes be partially real...",1
"This is a brilliant book. It is very well laid out. The ideas in the book are so very relevant to our times. The argumentation is very well presented, and very logical indeed. The positions that Jared takes in this book are positions not to be taken lightly. The lessons from the societies that have collapsed are so very relevant to our times.Yet, the one thing that was missing for me, is the effect of the sudden increase of our global population in the last 150 years, on the stresses that the world's environment must face today. The pressure on the world's resources is so dramatically different from the pressures of all the centuries ago. I am sure that with the seeming decrease in western populations, global migrations etc, the ways in which we will regard the problems of today, be different from the world of 200 years ago.All in all, a highly recommended book. It is a book to be read slowly, with care. The lessons are to be absorbed, not forgotten when the book is put down.",1

"This was a great movie. The beginning was a little rocky, but then it smoothed out a little bit. The movie had great special effects and a great cast. Some of my favorite characters were Odysseus (Armand Assante), Telemachus (Alan Stenson), and Calypso (Vanessa Williams). This movie was very gory, but in a way I think that made it better. In this epic poem by Homer, my favorite part was when Odysseus shot an arrow through the axe handles. Overall, my opinion of this movie is that its a masterpiece.",1
This book was thrilling. I love the way that it kept you on your toes no matter what was happening. I couldn't wait to find out what happened.,1
"The origional quality of the filming of this story is horrible. There are plenty of movies out there that are older yet far better. Also, the telling of the back story that doesn't exist in the play, but only become known to us through the dialogue is so much better. Ibsen could write extremely well and his work does not need to be revised.",1
"I bought this CD, advertised as ""Remastered"" from Tango Tienda as NEW.They listed their home office with Amazon as shipping from NY, however when I received the CD, not only did it arrived from ARGENTINA, but also it was the ARGENTINE pressing on SONY, the booklet consisted of a bad copy of the front and back covers, while in the middle there were no lyrics or other photos, only a black and white text of the basic credits. The RECORDING was the ORIGINAL VERSION, with only 9 TRACKS, NOT THE REMASTERED re-issue or the extra tracks at the end. It took me almost 2 months, but I finally received a refund, only because I was furious to have received an offer of 40% credit if I returned the CD. After my email, I got 100% refund.

"Baldacci tells a wonderful story and he introduces some memorable characters. In this book we meet Annabelle Conroy who is memorable even if not believable. On the other hand he leaves the development of the characters in the Camel Club. They were interesting in the first book because we met them. In this book there is no effort to develop the individual characters.I enjoyed the two separate stories that do come together. The rapport between Oliver and Annabelle was good.On the negative side, even though I realize that thrillers are not supposed to be completely true this was a little far fetched. Also it did not have the quality of past efforts.I also must comment that I do not like books that end with the beginning of a sequel. If you invest in over 400 pages you deserve an answer.I do wonder why the fixation with rare books. Dunning started it but others such as Meltzer and now Baldacci have picked it up.",1

"This is a great book for kids and will hopefully get my neice and nephew interested in history, which is a subject I dearly love and enjoy reading about. My only objection is to the vocabulary.

"The Bottom Line:Exceptionally well-crafted scenes of bloodshed (Cronenberg is one of the best directors when it comes to making movie violence seem actually violent) and a stellar supporting turn from William Hurt lift this thriller above the ordinary; it's not a great film, but it is one which will most likely linger in your mind.",1
"Truth be known, this band used to annoy me. But once I actually got this album and listened to it, I grew to like it quite a bit. It's hard not to. It's mostly upbeat catchy alt-pop, the kind you'd expect to hear in the early 90's. They do have a ""Best Of"" also, but most of those great songs are already on here. Included is ""Alison Road"", ""Until I Fall Away"", ""Found Out About You"", and the popular ""Hey Jealousy"". Any radio listener should know these songs, and the others are nearly as good. I recommend picking this disc up. There should be about 5 copies at your local used store. There's also a ""Deluxe"" version of this out.",1
This product is exactly what I expected. For the price its great. If your looking for somthing for serious shooting this is not your item but if your looking for costume or occational airsoft apparal then I would recoment this item.

"I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like a good read. My eyes were glued to this book, it was exciting and fun, but you never know what was going to happen next. This book also captivates a young audience; I would recommend it to anyone ages 11-14. It also had so many surprises in it. You could read it casually and then all of the sudden your eyes would widen with thrill. I also loved Carl Hiaasen's style of writing. It really draws you in, because he uses realistic language that thirteen year old actually use today. Not to mention the plot was also realistic, and could happen in everyday life. I would also unquestionably recommend his next book, Flush, to anyone out there. This New York Times Bestseller is certainly worth the trip to the library.",1
We used this book recently in oahu. My biggest complaint is that it was not helpful in choosing our Waikiki hotel as the descriptions are too vague.

"When I first started listening to Our Lady Peace, the enigmatic vocals and the awesome music behind Raine Maida's voice drew me in. Gravity is totally different. The old Our Lady Peace was eerie and had a creepy sound to them that was so alien to the American ear that it was either totally accepted or utterly hated. Their sound stayed the same during the first four albums, but Bob Rock took the helm, producing Gravity. Rock, who produced an album for Metallica, took what was OLP and made it into part of the machine we now call ""rock"". What happened to the ellusive and cryptic lyrics of ""Spiritual Machines"" or the cutting rifts on ""Clumsy""? Please, Our Lady Peace, if you are reading this, don't fall into the trap that is modern music. You seem to be on the brink, and you need to reaslize that if you do, you will take one of the best bands of all time down.",1

This movie does tell a story, and focuses on how Carter realizes what a waste his life has been, what he could have been -with his dead brother as an example- and of course he is not, and it does it very well. Not every movie has to be full of shootouts and gore. This is a great work of style, and the dull opinions of how the excess of style towers the plot (although respected ones) is a proof of how badly educated common audiences are (the ones who prefer linear stories). Forget the cynicism and watch this movie for what it is: a good piece of entertainment",1
"I have loved Michael Franks for years. I love his Caribbean soulful music. Great for first date of wine, great food and music that is soft and warm. I think everyone knows him from Popsicle Toes. Do not make music like this anymore; check out Antonio's Song from this album. Wanted this album because of its many hits through the years.",1
"Bought this to take to kids basketball games due to small/limited court side space availability. Works well for petite wife and kids, but dangerous for me (190lb) due to the wobbling of the three legs. When I sit, the legs spread out and feels as if they are ready to crumble. I haven't fallen down yet, but not waiting for that to happen either. Needless to say, I sit on the floor and wife/kids sit on the chair. Took one star away for that.Otherwise, it's extremely convenient - light weight, quick to setup, and fits anywhere in the car.",1
"Just read some of the reviews with a shaking head.When released this film was state of the art in terms of animation technology.The reason it ends so abruptly is that the intention was to finance the second film (last part of Two Towers and Return of the King) with the proceeds from the first.Sadly, lack of revenue did not allow that to happen.Personally, even as a Tolkein fan, I like the film.",1
"This is the kind of movie, I've noticed, that people either really like or can't stand at all. Cult-like, sort of.The film is true, if not in exact content, then at least to the spirit of the book, so if you disliked this movie you would almost definitely not like the book. Bret Easton Ellis' purpose in writing seems to be a barely-contained howl at the vacuousness of modern life, so if you don't especially like that kind of thing you would probably not find the film very entertaining. The film also has no real plot or storyline, which also seems to put off many, but the point of the film is to depict a lifestyle, a set of people and their conflicts with one another. It is about life, and life has no neat endings and beginnings.You either like this film or you don't. I did, but many people I know hated it. I still strongly recommend it, but I warn you: In the words of Hermann Hesse, it is ""not for everyone.""",1
"At the same time, a very professional scholarly work and an enjoyable read. Good at setting the middle eastern context of Lebanese history.However, the author seems to take sides when he is deconstructing the classical Lebanist version of history (such as the muslim religious persecutions, the mountain refuge, and the Shehabi state), as all his arguments go in the same anti-Lebanist direction.",1
"I gave the cd a 4 star because it only has a couple good songs. But all around it is a pretty good cd. I also think they need 2 sing about more realalisic things if you sing about down to earth things it makes a better song like KoRn all there song are serious unlike blink 182's. Also supporting my serious theroy ""whats my age again"" is a serious song and its there best song!. so all i am saying is they need 2 grow up and sing about more realalistic stuffp.s. "" korn is 1 of THe best younger bands out there they are better then blink 182 AND Limp Bizkit so i would buy FOLLOW THE LEADER b4 i would by ENAMA OF THE STATE . its just my opinion though",1
I have found this book to be a life saver in the business world. I am no longer in the dark with people and have increased my success with clients and customers dramatically. I feel like I've gained some kind of new magic power. Thanks again for one of the most intriguing and life changing reads.,1
"Val McDermid tells a story of four friends who discover Rosie, a dying young woman, as they are drunkenly making their way home. The young woman dies despite efforts to save her. The young men are suspects in Rosie's murder although the police can find no clear evidence to charge them, there is also no strong evidence to clear their names, and no other suspects seem to exist. The young men's lives are overshadowed by these events and many things turn out quite differently than they had hoped for.The second half of this novel jumps ahead 20 some years. As the anniversary of Rosie's death again approaches, death and suspicion raise their ugly heads again and everyone is again thrown into a nightmare of a spotlight. The confusion, hate and fear wrap themselves around the characters in a dark blanket of hopelessness. The only way out is for the person(s) who murdered Rosie to be revealed. The question is, who will survive the investigation!!!",1
"Some rock n rollers (and I am included) bear an interesting theory: classic music is indeed heavy metal music. If you take the violins from a Beethoven music and replace them for guitars, you will find heavy metal music. Michael Kamam proved that! And he also agreed with that theory himself. Listen to this great CD and you will understand it. The CD could have been even greater if Metallica and The San Francisco Simphony had chosen the ideal musics. I think that songs like Until It Sleeps, Memory Remains or Of Wolf And MAn, just dont fit well in a classic tune. They should have chosen the Metallicas ideal tunes. Imagine To Live is To Die, And Justice For All, Harvester of Sorrow, Unforgiven or My Friend Of Misery played with the Simphony. Well, theres a lot of space for a second show. But the Cd is great. At last something really good from Metallica. I thought the band had died after the album ""Metallica"".",1
"This is a very good daily devotional. I just have one very big disappointment in it, in that it refers to ""sub-conscience"". That's a man's term which did not come from the Bible nor from God. There is no such thing. There is habit and there is conscience, but the Bible NEVER refers to SUB-sonscience. In man's infinite sinful nature and the want to be God, he thirsts for knowledge which only takes him further from God because any knowledge about our behaviors that's not found in the Bible, is not from God. So take this devotional and be like those of us who like watermelon, eat what's good and spit out the seeds.God bless you <><",1
"I love the Carpenter's and this CD has a great selection of their love songs. I play it all the time.If you like the Carpenters, you will love this CD too.",1
"This is AFI's second EP, and most likely the best. The covered Holloween song from the Misfits is great, and the other tracks are good too. A good thing is that the price for this CD is not bad at all, for if you want to buy something else, and you got a little bit of dough on you. I gave it 4 stars though because, this CD is a little, weird. Like with the song Fall Children, it just freaked me out when I read the lyrics. So go and buy this CD anywhere you can, for it is good and worth it. Check out my reviews with the other AFI albums.",1
"I want to thank Image for a wonderful transfer. The sound and picture quality is wonderful on this DVD. The story has been told here so no need to go over it again. Very enjoyable story of the first rocket into space. I would add that the ""pinkish"" color used to ""colorize"" Mars looks very good, much better than the ""cinemagic"" used in the later movie, Angry Red Planet.",1
"Thrill, suspense, good acting are a plus.Tumultuous sex scenes and the large gift emphasizethe resulting love and pity, especially due to the longduration of the plot ( three years make a spya true wife ). A dramatic ending.Morality : never use young inexperienced studentsto perform a monumental task. They are no match totheir evil counterpart. Be flexible, change plans,bring in bigger guns. Anyway: this is good entertainment.",1
"I confess I'm something of a nut when it comes to Ancient Egyptian anything, so when I bought this novel by Ms. George, I could hardly wait to read it. It fulfilled all my expectations and more. Cleopatra's sad story is well-known to any student of history, so the story won't have any surprises far as the better-known aspects of her life and death are concerned, but the language used to express Cleopatra is perfect, the setting as well. For the first time, you feel as if you really know this woman and her thoughts, as well as what her expectations of her two major loves were. Anyone who is an Egyptophile will love this book. I do.",1
"My 5 year old son loves it, because he wants to be a red ninja. Poorly made, cheap fabric. It doesn't stay on him, sizing is a bit off.",1
"I enjoyed this book but it is far from my favorite Barbara Michaels' mystery. In this story, Meg is recovering from an accident which is causing hallucinations. She asks her wealthy aunt for assistance and is offered a six month stay in an old, Victorian style house in Pennsylvania. When Meg arrives there she finds that her aunt's stepson, Andy, is living in a small house on the property and serving as a caretaker. Unfortunately, Meg and Andy did not get along as children and get off to a rough start when they meet again as adults. Shortly after moving into the house, Meg has more hallucinations, but this time Andy can see them, too. They soon figure out that they are seeing former residents of a house that used to stand on the site. These are tragic figures and the evil that confronted them is apparently still on the property.",1
"The book is very informative regarding the operation of many electronic circuits and their practical application. It is not a place for the beginner to start learning basic electronics. You may require additional reference books to make your way through Mr. Davidson's book. The book is not well coordinated with reference diagrams and pictures to the text. There are a lot of references to diagrams which,in turn, are not visually close to the text. The page flipping gets annoying. Additionally, there are mistakes in labeling schematic diagram components in some chapters. If you do not understand basic circuit operation, these mis-labelings could easily confuse the point Mr. Davidson is trying to make. I used the text for a review and for the practical troubleshooting advice. It served that purpose well. I think that this book will be a good shop reference which I will use often.",1
"This is a definitive ""B"" movie, but it is great fun to watch. Two slave girls escape from a slave spaceship only to crash land on a remote planet who's sole permenant inhabitant is a reclusive nobleman. He always has ""Guests"" because the planet is in a ""Sargasso Sea"" of space. The problem is, the guests keep disappearing. The girls soon catch on to his hunting preference and fight back. Lots of T&A, but nowhere near porn by todays standards. Fun special effects.",1
"This is such a wonderful movie. It is my favorite movie and I can watch it over and over again. All the characters bring something special to this film; my favorite are both Cady and Regina. The performers are so great; there are many scenes that truly touch my heart and move me. Some include: when Cady falls upward into the bin, when Gretchen explains to Cady about what had happend at the Halloween party, and the scene where Cady finally joins the Mathletes.My signficant other also likes this movie very much. It has romance, drama, war (to an extent) and action. This is one movie he never complains about seeing again.Please see this movie if you never have. It's the perfect, modern movie. Great acting, wonderful story, likable characters, and quite moving.",1
"I remember this film and yet in 1982 I was 3 years old. This film left a profound impact on me somehow. The story is excellent for children. A young boy builds a snowman and flies to the north pole for a snowman party and then returns. This was my first influence to tragedy as the snowman melted. (sorry if i ruined it for you) Also the piece ""Walking in the Air"" by George Winston is wonderfully beautiful!",1
"The books is useful and would help many people (including myself). If was an author, I would have added detail chapters on Java Beans, Applets, testing of RMI. I like the chapter on J2ME!",1
"If you play your Xbox a lot like I do, you will definitely need this. The battery tends to last me several weeks on one charge and they can even charge while the console is off, so you don't have to be wired if you don't want to. I also recommend theXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitwhich can charge multiple batteries at once.",1
LOVE THE MOVIE!! alot of people didnt like it but the thought and the way the cinamia flowed watched it now 15 times,1
"When I was a kid this movie was all the rave. I saw it with two of my friends and loved it so much that I made my two younger brothers watch it. It's about a tightly-knit group of friends who are trying to find a way to spend their last weekend together. Because of a greedy company their neighborhood is about to be turned into a golf course. While exploring the attic they find an authentic 17th century treasure map, deciding to find the gold and save the neighborhood they set out to a sumtarrenan cavern full of booby-traps and skelatons. You've got to see this film, there are a few jokes not meant for younger kids like the breaking of a certain part on the famous statue David and one character Mouth mis-translating packing instructions to a Spanish housekeeper. Very Funny! Rent it!",1
"This CD is sooo diverse. Of course they do have some down right silly songs like ""Barbie Girl"" and ""Docter Jones"", but they are so catchy, you can't help but like 'em. There are also more serious songs like ""Turn Back Time"", ""Be A Man"", and ""Good Morning Sunshine"". It is an excellent CD for anyone who likes pop music, or is looking for something new and different. =)",1
"Excellent soundtrack and picture although I would definetly like to see more impressive works such as PULSE or the Delicate Sound of the ThunderI know that Waters wants to leave the Pink Floyd age behind but those 2 video works made history and deserve to be in DVD formatHowever this DVD is fantastic, a must have",1
You must have this album and you must have their first full lenght album A Small Boy and Grey Heaven. They deserve support !!!!Caliban rocks.,1
"While all of the Stepp Sisters are very relatable in one way or another to every individual, I felt like Ellie was the most relatable to my own person. I really enjoyed this book and the trials and tribulations that went with the characters. I stated in my review of ""Getting What You Want"" that Ms. Love was minorly lacking in the vocabulary as she used the same adjective on several different occasions over and over, making it feel as if she didn't know any other word to use it. This time around, I feel like someone slapped her on the wrist and told her to use different words. It was great, a quick, relatable read for the hopeless romantic in anyone.",1
"Well, I believe I killed my light bulb by leaving it on for a week and then spraying it with a hose while on. I brought it a year ago and it has destroyed a colony of flying insects to say in the least.It does kill some mosquitoes despite many articles saying it does not but mostly it kills moths. It was rather easy to replace, two screws and two bolt screws to remove and then you just pull and replace. I hope it lasts for more than one year though.",1
"A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra is definitely one of the best books on the Imperial Family! Told through the diary entries, letters, and memoirs of the Imperial Family themselves and some of their closest friends and family, this book definitely gives you a clear insight into the lives of Nicholas and Alexandra.",1
The padding is very nice. I was surprised with the quality for the price. Im gonna purchase another one and would recommend it.,1
"This album is one of King's best. If you like progressive metal and horror flick-inspired lyrics you need to buy this album. The music on this CD draws heavily from the classical genre, but the music is totally heavy metal (the guitar solos are sublime). King wrote ""Them"" as a concept album; each song is linked to the other to tell a horrific tale. The story begins with grandma coming home from the asylum (that is when the fun starts!). Soon all manner of supernatural chaos ensues as grandma resurrects the spirits of ""them"" for her evening tea party. A must have for the complete metal library.",1
"Well, OK, the Master did sell himself. He liked money and the things it could buy, so he lent his name and image to this fairly so-so TV series.As you consider buying this anthology DVD set, then, look at it as getting Hitch by the pound. For the money, you get hours of stuff you can watch while ironing or running your washing machine. And, whenever Alfred himself takes the stage, you can count on some funny business and great, droll props.Only one or two of these episodes, though, bear his personal mark.So, consider buying it by the pound. The quality of the restorations is great, and it looks mighty fine on your video shelf.Besides, don't you have some ironing to do?",1
Makes me think of my Caribbean island vacations which brought back some good memories. Good one to have in your library.,1
"I bought both of the albums when the band was getting heavy radio play. I can't get over how even though I couldn't always decipher the mumbling - it sounded like the guy was singing about being cheated on in a flannel shirt, broken down Converse sneakers kind of way. Some songs just sound like they are being sung by a cuckold like that line in Office Space about how everyone thinks your girlfriend's cheating on you. How Onion!",1
"It's about the bugs life. The story is more of an ant story on how they live. And at the end, the story reveals that there is nothing impossible to achieve when they are as one. As the saying goes united we stand divided we fall.",1
"Good piece of video that deals with the rise of the anti-christ. How could anyone believe that such a thing could happen? Interestingly enough the film touches on the signs that will forshadow that time, wars and rumours of wars, Israel becoming a focus of world attention, a single economy being established around the world (the euro?), earthquakes, hunger, changes in the environment.....mmmm, sounds like the time might be right to watch the film and think about the issue.Michael York is good as the antichrist, the special effects make this an entertaining production, but the message is worth pondering after it's all finished.....",1
"I bought the BT500 after a recommedation by CR. The head set was easy to pair. That was about the only nice feature. It kept dropping the signal, not while talking, on stand-by. There was no noise cancelling feature so it picked up all road noice. This made voice dialing very difficult.People I was talking to complained the back ground noise cause my voice to break up. The only way I could hear them was to apply pressure to the ear piece.When I wrote the company to ask for either a different size ear piece or a suggestion to help with the fit, I was told ""it only comes in one size and the only suggestion would be take it back to where I got it"". I did and purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510.I am very happy with this new headset.",1
"Even though Owen is very small, his character is larger than life, and his story is both tragic and magical. What impressed me most about this book was the way the story ties together so perfectly in the end. It just blew me away! Yes, there are many imperfections in this novel: it's too long, the female characters aren't solid, and if you hate liberals you're going to hate it, but Owen's story reached me in a way that few books ever do. I gave a copy to my mother and she had very much the same reaction.",1
"Ella Enchanted is about a teenage girl from the kingdom/town of Frell. I have both read the book and seen the movie, and am glad to report that both are WONDERFUL!",1
It definately pays to read all the reviews on a product before buying. All the reviews on this speaker system were right on. It is the best for the money that anyone could purchase in my opinion. It sure brings my laptop to life with it's rich sounds. The subwoofer is rather large but the overall sound is amazing. I am extremely happy my new Logitech Z-2300.,1
"I purchased this toaster back in February based on others' reviews and have not been disappointed. After several months of use, I most enjoy the easy-to-clean crumb tray, large oven capacity and quality of toasting/cooking. The only downside is that the toast level needs to be higher--thus a longer toasting time--if I want toast marks on my food. Even though it's a larger toaster oven that takes up more counter space than my old B&D, I do like the way it looks in my kitchen. Although I did not rate this 5 stars (because I believe there's always room for improvement with appliances), I highly recommend it.",1
"I bought this toy cheap, knowing it would most likely not hold up. We have a Pitt bull who loves to chew soft things. He had this completely torn apart in less than 1 hour. I will say for a smaller dog or a dog who isn't a huge chewer it would have lasted a long time, the construction is done very well.",1

"This was a super hit for my year old daughter - she still plays with it months later. The peices fit easly, they are light weight and she likes to ""pet"" them.The only negative point is that after repeatedly being put in her mouth some of the coloring on the edges has worn off - most likely ingested - its doesnt seem to bother her tho. :)",1
Saw II is the rare sequel that you find thats even better then the original (and the original was great). The story is easy to follow and full of suspense. The story twists and turns at every corner to the point where you think just about anything could happen. The acting was great and full of known actors. I dont quite understand the poing of Beverly Mitchell who is a decent name in acting and plays such a useless role in the film. The DVD extras on this film are well worth getting the DVD. They have a making of each of the torture devices section. They tell you just how each of the effects were accomplished and its really interesting. there are other good bonus features too. You wont be dissapointed with this DVD!,1
"EDITH WHARTON's wonderful novel is certainly good looking on the screen ,but it is a misfire most of the time,because we simply can't feel anything for those characters.One must salute SCORSESE for trying something different ,but this is simply not his cup of tea.Actors in general are not to blame,especially MICHELE PFEIFFER who tries to inject some vitality to her character.DAY-LEWIS is incredibly stiff and so is RYDER as gorgeous as she is.If you read most of WHARTON's novels, you know most of her men are boring characters except in THE HOUSE OF MIRTH.Fortunally for us, an adaptation of this novel is due soon.",1
"If Mr. Valentine believes that ALL liberals are motivated by emotions and ALL conservatives are motivated by their logical heads, then why is the book called ""Right from the HEART""? I was just wondering...",1
"I ordered the product based on the positive reviews on the web. I'm not impressed, but I know that when it comes to beauty items, everyone's skin is different. I absolutely love the smell, it is refreshing and delicious. I think it did give me better looking skin overall, but it is so thick on my face that I can hardly stand it because it feels oily after a couple of hours. It does leave the skin very soft, but it causes small breakouts, for me at least. My skin type is combination and I wouldn't recommend this for daily use. I don't feel much moisturizing action going on either, to be honest, it is definitely not suited for harsh winter days since it doesn't protect your face at all. I'll keep using it as an on and off night time moisturizer since it has the AHA, but I will not order it in the future, it is just not suited for me. I have given it 2 weeks before writing the review since beauty items need time to provide results, but it hasn't worked out for me.",1
"Brown is probably one of the few albums I have never taken out of my cd changer. It puts you in a mellow, vibin' mood that few albums can do. It's not the typical cd when you love one or two songs and then the next ten or so are crap. EVERY song on Brown you will LOVE. I will be getting her new album Corduroy Boogie asap and another copy of Brown cause it's simply worn out.",1

"Actually, I have quite a few of Craig T's Cd's and I must say....I have not been disappointed by any of them yet. Most are familiar with cd's that have 1 or 2 hits and the rest is the equivalent of fill music. This Artist always seems to have a fresh approach resulting in a creativity comes through in the music. To guyz like this I say...may the force continue to be with you.",1
"The debt to Bram Stoker is immediately evident but this shouldn't entirely detract from what is, in its own right, a genuinely disturbing story, set in a Carpathian castle and featuring a spinechilling and gratifying remorseless conclusion. The structure - a series of letters, journals and transcripts - obviously and unapologetically owes much to Bram Stoker. The language is unspectacular but effective; he has a spare and quite classically Gothic style which ensures that the pages keep turning over. Not an epoch-marking book, but certainly worth reading.",1
"First off...not everybody will like let alone stand this film. However, its' appeal to the iconclastic crowd is strangely bewitching.I once showed ""Being John Malkovich"" at a Friday gathering when the film was in its' hayday. Many seemed confused as to why the film had garnered such great reviews. Cecil was the follow-up movie of the evening that answered their questions. A fun time discussing it was had by all that night.I can best describe Cecil as a tongue and cheek dark comedy lampooning the movie industry, Hollywood, its' biases and image. The punk, anti-establishmentarian and counterculture fringe element in you should enjoy this feature.",1
"Awesome, it makes a person think twice about whats going on in our world now of days with all sorts of thing coming to pass like the bible says. So great that it keeps a person wanting more.",1
I have always meant to read this classic book - have enjoyed the film and now it coming out again with Leonardo Decaprio as the Great Gatsby I finally took the plunge. It was excellent - I must admit it me took a little while to get into the old style of writing - but once there it was worth the effort. No wonder it is a classic - it is wonderful to take yourself back to a bygone era when money and perceptions took over and no-one really knew where someone came from or how they got there. I loved it - would highly recommend everyone reads this book at least once in their lives.,1

"As soon as I picked up the box and read the summary on the back,I had a feeling that this was a different kind of movie.What I didn't realize was that I was just about to watch the most influential film for the new generation of 20 somethings.The ""intelligent filth""that spews forth from our two heroes,Dante and Randall,was unlike anything I had encountered outside of a night at the local pub with my friends. If you like intelligent dialogue,loads of swears,or ever worked in any aspect of the customer service industry,then this is the movie you MUST see.",1
"I guess I have to agree with other reviews I've read in print and online - this movie was good for the first hour, and then the ending was kind of a deflation of the mood that was set in the start. The nature of the zombie/vampires was not well explored, particularly the clear demonstration of their vestigial intelligence and apparent social organization. The film just kind of gallumphs to a close. I would also have to agree with criticisms of the sometimes-chunky CGI; thi sis the first film I've ever saw that I actually thought, gee, it wouldn't be so bad if at some future date they went back and retouched some of the computer graphics. Much of it was surprisingly cheesy. Will Smith does a good job in his role -- loved the dog, as well. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)",1
"Funny that a movie about a scriptwriter has a very sweet but unimaginable scenario. From the moment on you have a pretty good idea about what is going to happen. Making the 2,5 hours a long sit.Guy is wanted for communist sympathies - gets amnesia - ends up in a town where they think he is someone else - they find out - he goes back but understands that life is better there than in 1950s LA.The end is even a little too moralizing: The Constitution is open for every belief, even communism!!The acting is however fine, Jim Carrey shows again he is a lot more than the Mask and he almost reaches the standard he set for himself in the superb 'Truman Show', Martin Landau is sweet as his 'father'.The settings of the movie are great, the feeling of the 1950 is perfectly shown. The warm cosiness of a small town glows from the screen and the setting of the movietheater is great.Too bad it's so incredibly predictable.",1
"When I first decided to read this book, it was based on the author's voice, because he said that he was skipping over chapters in a particularly popular book. I can only think that he was talking about Harry Potter. I too, wished for Potter to be a bit more dark than it was, so the idea that an older version (Older meaning High School Senior) book was on the rise was very interesting to me. It was definitely not anything like Harry Potter, but the book was simple, and an easy read and I did enjoy it. I give it 4 starts instead of 3, because I think it was a good attempt and I appreciate when someone tries to execute something with their own passion through their heart. I think if anything, that shines through.",1
"This book is ""classic Linda Howard"" to a point, but I scored it only 4 stars, because I feel the book wrapped up too neatly and quickly.Also, the lead male character was too cookie-cutter beefcake. The female lead was very nicely developed and original, but you felt (if you are a Howard fan and have read all her books) that you could interchange her male lead with any of her other males like Mr. Perfect's Sam or Mackenzie's Wolf or Joe or Chance or....If you are a Linda Howard fan you will want this book; it is a keeper. I just wish the problems hadn't been so conveniently and too-neatly wrapped up and the male lead so cookie-cutter.",1

"I think the basic premise of this story is solid enough. Where it falls short is in the development of the storyline and its characters. For one thing, I think the main plot would've benefited if the story were a bit longer, allowing time to develop the relationship between Nevada and Eden and also adding more depth to the characters. In its current state, the characters seemed superficial and the story rushed. Most disturbing is Eden's discovery of her feelings for Nevada and after so little foundation on why that occurred. Eden and Nevada spend a lot of time together but the story skips through much of that and focuses on only sex scenes and sexy dialogue. For me, it leaves a lot to be desired.So, read this only if you can't find anything else better to do with your time.",1
".The album starts badly with Buddy and Julie Miller proving they can't get close to the electrifying original of 'Paper Thin'. The title track is another let down, and Buddy Guy's 'Feels Like Rain' fails to live up to Hiatt's own version. Can't blame them all for trying though.Bonnie Raitt's stonking remake of 'Thing Called Love' is so good you can forgive its inclusion while wishing that more of the album was Hiatt's obscurer songs like Patty Griffin's lovely 'Take it Down' and Roseanne Cash's 'This is the Way We Make a Broken Heart'. Hiatt's well-known songs are well-known because he did such a great version. Trying to improve on them is a waste of time, though Rodney Crowell has a good stab at it on 'She Loves the Jerk'.It's an interesting album for Hiatt fans, but one that will probably have them backtracking to the originals to hear the songs done properly, for the most part.",1

"I evaluated 100+ cargo storage devices. I rolled the dice and went with this unconventional solution. Though the PackRight is rated for 100 pounds, the volume capacity is perfect for sleeping bags, pillows, blankets, etc. Installation only takes minutes and requires only 1 person. My first install was 20-30 minutes. My second install was only 5-10 minutes since my straps were already set for my vehicle. For our next trip, I will try to find a way to bolster the bottom of the bag. It was supportive but did tend to sag. *** Now for a word of warning. I was pulled over by a Colorado State Trooper and given a warning. He could not see my license plate and my home state does not require a front vehicle plate. In the future, I will move my plate to the front of the vehicle and put a dummy paper copy on the PackRight.",1
"This is the album I should have bought first but I was a tool and waited two years and bought Angst. Not to take anything away from Angst mind you. I'm just mad at myself becase Money should have been the first in my huge Kmfdm collection. Oh well I have it now and boy is it good. Bargeld, Help us..., Vouge, and Sex on the Flag are the best tracks in my opinion. This is the first of Kmfdm's full length studio albums that anyone should buy.",1
This is not the right model for 2000 and 2001 Toyota corolla. I returned the items and got my money back with no hassles. Great customer service and definitely stick to Amazon.,1
This is a great book for children to explore their imagination. I love to use it every fall with my students.,1
"OXO makes great products, so it's no surprise that these tongs are great to work with. My old tongs lasted 20 years and I suspect these will last the next 20.",1
We have several Lonely Planet guides and this guide for Peru did not disappoint. It had lots of useful tips for the places we visited!,1
"I bought this DVD of telenovela, couse I've seen it and I liked it, so I wanted to have it in my shelf in case i would like to wach it again.I like about this DVD that it is 950 min, so the movie is not shortened.Not nice things are:1. it does not have any other language subtitles.2. DVD packadge does not incloode anything else except 4 DVD's. If I am paying this money, I would like to have at least some photos of telenovela, actors.",1
"I thought the last review was good but he tried to give it 3 1/2 stars so it rounded down to 3 which isn't right for this very cool disc. So I'll give it a five to correct his theory of glass half empty. Although every time I see five stars on Amazon, I always think girlfriends and moms. Hmm who gets 5 stars. But as the previous reviewer noted, this is a big departure, which for me is a good thing. Quite refreshing. And I always cry at the end of ""follow"". A lot of good songs and beats. And I love the Cherry Kava Kava Song. I heard this cd on Kcrw and bought it and am very pleased!",1
"Thanks for reading. Actually 3.5 starsI love all the Eagles albums, This is their third album, and not as good as their first two. Don Felder was a welcome addition to the band on this album, adding a rawer, harder, rockier edge to their music.Does contain some gems including ""Already Gone "" "" My Man"" "" Is it true"" and "" The best of my love""Fans will love it, but if you're new to the Eagles you might want to try some of their later stuff first.This is the best Eagles line-up, but they didn't quite get it right here. The Successor to this "" One of These nights"" is the best in my opinion.Still, this is a good album, and a must for fans of this genre!Enjoy!",1
This book is a great read and very original material. I love the creative different classes of characters. There is great drama between the characters and a very good story line. I highly recommend for anyone that loves fantasy.,1
"I wanted to like this book, but found it too academic in style, and with not many new ideas. One redeeeming point was an excellent bibliography.I found it a bit self-serving to have testimonials from other Harvard Business School faculty on the back cover of the book. Could these persons really offer an impartial assessment of a book written by a colleague they see almost every day?",1
"The item was a gift ffor someone. it came quickly, and she loved it. The material is great quality. I will purchase more.",1
"Product is nice except you have no way to ""attach"" the strap. We guess that is just goes under the flap..Wished they would have spent another doller and put some hardware to attach on it.",1

"Not only is The Cure one of the best bands but they also have a talented singer. Robert Smith has been out snice the 70s, and still is playing music to this day. He sounds the same, he looks the same. Any band that can stay play at his age must be very strong and a great musican.",1
"Tin Man starring Zooey Deschanel is a new take on The Wizard of Oz. I like this miniseries but I found part 3 a bit disappointing. If you can put up with Deschanel's bland, one-trick pony acting then good for you! Good thing Richard Dreyfuss steals the movie, he plays the Mystic Man. I like the references to the 1939 classic like the waitress outfit is fashioned after Judy Garland's blue & white dress, funny. Interesting film but not as scary as some of the reviewers have stated. Check it out sometime!",1
The songs are great. The CD is not remastered. The sound quality is poor. Asmahan's voice on old records is much better than on CDs. The track listing is not accurate. Sahirto toul el leil is not there.,1
"Many other bands may sell more albums, but they don't really matter, do they? If you are void of substance in your musical catalog, you may want to try this album. You may not dig all the songs on the first listen, but the songs grow on you and provide satisfaction... This album has its fair share of rockers and ballads. ""Save You"" is in the mold of ""Do the Evolution"" ""Spin The Black Circle."" What I really look forward to is seeing these tunes performed in concert. Peace",1
I bought this CD back in the day from the used CD bin. It's one of the only albums I actually look for and listen to in it's entirety.,1
"This is a good general-purpose tripod for Sony Handicams. The remote control handle is a must-have feature for decent videos. With practice, slow zooms are possible.My biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head. It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However, the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price, make this a good buy.",1
"Man, I love the beastie boys and I love this C.D. even though it is almost completely made up of re-mixes of Body Movin' that you can find elsewhere. The lyrics are good(""if you play Defender I could be your Hyper Space"") and the music is cool, too. The re-mixes are all different and they don't take away from the original songs' qualities. If you really like the Beastie Boys you should get it and if you are not too sure if you like the Beastie Boys, it is not too expensive for an import so you might as well check it out anyway. Final Note: If you don't have the American version of this already than get this version, otherwise it is not a necessary addition to a Beastie Boys collection.",1
The lemon grass was too much for me to use at one time. I don't know if I could freeze it. I wasn't too thrilled with the look of some of it.,1
I'm a history lover but will read novels and memoirs. There were points in the book were the author lost me. However not much said about the mother. Title is not good for this book.,1
"This is a very fun toy! But there are a few problems with it.First of all I don't think it comes with enough balls.Second of all, My kids constantly are trying to put other things down the tube and their other toys like blocks etc... get stuck down there and it's almost imposible to get them out.It would be better if there was some way it unsnapped apart so you could get things out of it that got stuck.",1
"currently on deployment, i got these in less than 2 weeks...just short of a guy on a jet ski meeting the ship in the middle the ocean with the package....very pleased with shipping",1
"For those who have enjoyed Jando's interpretations of the Beethoven piano sonatas, they will enjoy Jando's sonata 15. However, I would agree with one of the other reviewers that this CD is a bad deal because the other pieces included are very inferior in quality. I'm sure that Jando plays them well enough, but they are not nearly on the level of the majority of the Beethoven piano sonatas.",1
"My 3 year old will sit and watch this movie. I am not going to say it is his favorite, he would honestly rather be watching the 1966 batman, don't ask me why, but thankfully he will sit though this too. After he watched this movie a few times he was saying the letter sound when the letter came up.One of the annoying things is the kids pick up the letter sounds exactly how they say them and when the W comes up it says the sound about 3 times in a row, now my kids will say the W sound multiple times because they think that is how it pronounced.",1
"This book gives you a good first overview, but you absolutely have to get a book on your state's regulations as well, especially if you live in a highly regulated state like Massachusetts. This book for example only gives you a vague idea on how to handle the security deposit, but Massachusetts state law is very specific and not following the rules precisely may cost you the deposit plus penalties.",1
"It's probable that you've never heard of this band, although I think they're better than most music on the radio today. Pilot Speed has a great sound with meaningful lyrics, not such a common combination in today's music world. It would be great if these guys were more well known; I definitely think they deserve it. It would also be great if their two original albums were available in the US.My favorite tracks are: I won't blame you, Alright, Ambulance, and Into the WestHope you give it a try!",1
"Boyd Raeburn's band was one of the most innovative of its time, one in which swing, bebop and symphonic music were combined in a totally unique way. My only caveats are that tracks 13 and 16 are reversed ('Hip Boyd's' is actually 'Duck Waddle' and vice versa) and that the last four tracks are actually Johnny Richards recordings (Raeburn's last arranger) featuring Boyd's male vocalist, but since there are 26 tracks, that isn't so bad. Some of the music is absolutely transcendental, and most of the recording quality is excellent. I highly recommend this recording to anyone who would like to hear big-band swing stretch itself!",1
"Chain came a tangled mess, and continued to tangle every time it touched itselfThe sterling silver was really very pretty, and the necklace looked really niceIf only the chain wasn't such a painIts INCREDIBLY thin and gets caught up in itself like no otherand the fine-ness makes it hard to unknot",1
"John Carter was a fun corny action movie based off of Edgar Rice Burrow'sBook Princess of Mars. It was a masterpiece that was not recognized as a masterpiece. The acting was very good, which made up for the cornyness of the film. The special effects were very good as well, along with the score. Director Andrew Stanton, did fairly good at portraying the John Carter we all love, those of us who have read the book. Taylor Kitsh did an amazing job acting the part. When I walked into the theater I was expecting good but not great. I was wrong",1
I was needing a clip for my belt and had to buy the whole kit to get it. Loved the skin but the clip it self was made out of cheep thin plastic and seems a little unstable. It does the job but I thought I would be getting a clip similar to the clip that came with my older Creative MP3. The player spins around on the clip instead of staying in one place.,1

"I am very disappointed with the Leap Pad I bought for my child over the holidays. Although I bought plenty of cartridges (most are $14.99 + Tax), my daughter does not find her Leap Pad all that exciting. Once in awhile she will take it out to play the games. The games quickly become redundant to my daughter who is a bright 4-year-old. Three times now I have watched my daughter poke at her Leap Pad with a bored look on her face.Suggestion to the company: Please make Leap Pads with an AC outlet ability for the children who do love their Leap Pads. Keeping the game supplied with fresh batteries is expensive!",1
"The entire series is marvelous! All of the characters are such fun (I'm rather fond of Summerset, myself). Most of all, there is such wicked humor scattered in with the love - and the murders. The BEST is Morris' reference to his ""vintage videos"". I won't give away the zinger in ""Rapture"", but I was in hysterics! I can hardly till I have the rest of the collection.",1
"I originally bought this book when it was first released and it has been an all time favourite since; it's great to see it out now in ebook format. It was only when I read Olivia Joules that I found I liked it far better than Bridget Jones: the tongue in cheek humour and standard Fielding touch for character realism make it an absolute must for girly Bonds everywhere. I know this book is relatively unknown but give it a chance - I always come back to it like I would an old friend. This will be about my 16th time reading it, and I know I'll still want another go at some point! If this isn't a cult classic then hey, it should be.",1
This sander is light duty. But not too bad of a tool. One of the best uses for it is to use it instead of a grinder. The slower speed really make it well suited to grinding and shaping edges. And for polishing work. Use the blue zirconia belts and you will be able to grind like crazy. I found the disc is only good for steel that is soft as it is too fast for wood or hardened steel. I have ground almost 100 plane irons and other tools on mine and it is stilll going. I use it atlest a hour a day. For the price it is a good little tool.,1
"The Bottom Line:If you're the type of person who can be entertained for 2 hours just by watching attractive people be attractive then by all means watch this movie (and also check out Mr. and Mrs. Smith/The Thomas Crown Affair), but if you actually like plots and intrigues then take any of Hitchcock's other films before you watch To Catch a Thief.",1
"In this brief and lovely book, the narrator, Leo, goes on a search for his uncle, missing for fifty years. In the process, he travels back in time to depression era Kentucky, a literary device which is beautifully done and does not seem at all out of place. The author's prose is straightforward and moving in its simplicity, and themes of hardship, loss, remembrance and recovery are woven into the story in a way that stays with you. One of the best books I've read in a long time.",1
"A fascinating look at the ancient city of Pompeii, but it seemed rather dull at times. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about Rome's aqueduct system. One would think the eruption of Vesuvius would merit more than just a glancing treatment. Somewhat disappointing, but still a good read.",1
No linux drivers so I can't use i on my laptop. It works great on my xp desktop though. I can't comment on vista. Good audio quality.,1
"This book was referenced in another book that means a lot to me, but I never checked it out. When I re-read ""In the Eye of the Storm"" by Bishop Robinson and recognized how this book impacted him, I decided to check Amazon on the chance I might still be able to read it and understand its impact on Bishop Robinson. Now I do understand, and I recommend it especially to anyone in the LGBT movement, especially any like me who are devout Christians, in order to understand our mission and purpose in this world. There are few copies left, and it may never be republished, so anyone who thinks it might be important to read should take this opportunity!",1
"I had three sources of study materials for my CISA exam which I took in June 2005. The CISA Review Manual, MicroMash and Exam Cram 2. Of the three the Review Manual was probably the most complete, but the Exam Cram 2 re-organized the materials better and made better connections between the information and real life. MicroMash was just too dense for my tastes. As a recommendation I would have to say for those of you planning to take the December test: get both the CISA material AND the Exam Cram 2 book. Read the section in the CISA book and then read the corresponding chapter in the Exam Cram 2. It really helps. I passed.",1
I thought it would whistle but it doesn't. I really like it still though and it also comes in different colors.,1
"An absolutly wonderful book! Ecspecially after the ""Sword of Shannara""!! I couldn't put it down, if your looking for a fantastic read, read this book. I give Terry Brooks a standing ovation for the ""Elfstones of Shannara""!!",1

It's all good, and the longer Patterson remix is great as well...",1

"I heard the first two selections played on a classical station that broadcasts over the web. Both selections became instant favorites of mine. The suite in D has a haunting beauty (I love the intro), and the concerto no 2 in G has a wonderfully playful style. Both are a pleasure to listen to. I'm looking forward to hearing the concerto no 1 in D when I get my CD.",1
"I give it only 4 stars because the book is mostly making fun of the negative side of what they experienced, instead of a complete objective review. I did not work in I-banking or on Wall Street, but from their writing, I believe the authors' accounts were true and sincere. They were accurate accounts of what they did, saw and what they were thinking. The writing is hilarious.",1
"Hey, this is, I am told the precursor to Aliens and that whole series of monster movies on spaceship. Well it is a fun story, crazy sets, typical to the 50's, and so dated. It kept making me just a bit crazier than usual and I was glad when the monster grabbed the nut opening the carton of cigarettes. For the Gods sake, even Jules Verne had more sense than that. All those glass bottles and open everythings... Jeeze mareez this ship was a death trap before it got off the ground.But, anyway, the movie is a classic and is really well worth the time to rent first and then decide to buy. It matters because it is absolutely a good story.Just remember it was a really scary movie for its time and damn good one now days. Worth a late night, munch some popcorn and laugh at the sets but still shiver at the concept type movie.",1
"""The Lost Traveller"" continues where ""Frost in May "" ended.However the name of the main character has been changed from Nanda Grey to Clara Batchelor.This book is about Clara's life throughout her teenage years.It is a wonderful and moving novel which deals with Clara's intense relationship with her parents and her life after she leaves her strict convent boarding school.It is set during world war one and is,in itself, a very tragic novel.I would reccomend reading it as part of the series rather than on it's own.The characters are so real that it's hard to beleive it's a fictional novel.I love this book and this series and it's really suitable for anyone.Read it.",1
"Boy... this guy sure stretched his material out pretty far. I mean, on numerous occasions I had to check to make sure that I was actually making progress because I was reading the exact same words I read on the previous page. The idea of avoiding high liability costs is an important one, but you can't help but think that 20-30 pages would have been more than enough.",1
"Ok, we all know dvd is quickly going he way of VHS and if you are like me you kick yourself every time you waste your money buying a ""has been"" format, however, until this one is transferred to BluRay we gotta buy the dvd because we just got to have all the Stephen King movies..haha",1
I was pleased to find this product. They do not stay as sharp or last as long as the originals. All things considered it is a good product. The only other option for me is to throw away the sharpener.,1

"When I first saw the Exorcist it was late at night and I was watching the last forty-five minutes, and I was convinced to buyit the next day. As I watched it from the beginning, I got bored,but not for long. The flashes with that demon face was enough to give me nightmarish thoughts during daylight. Linda Blair did superb job as Regan, the girl posessed by the devil(or something close to it). The crawl down the stairs had me freaked. And I had seen the other two Exorcist movies before the original. I recommend this movie to anyone with a strong stomach, and doesn't scare easy.",1
"The characters were appealing. However, it was to me a book written as so many are on the lives of the wealthy.",1
I love this movie so much! Though I wish it was cheaper to buy or you could rent it for longer.,1
"I really like war movies, especially WWII. This movie takes place in WWI, and is about Australian coal miners helping out on the front lines by digging deep to penetrate German defenses. But, more than that there are several interesting character stories (including a love story between the main character and a girl back home) that had me riveted throughout the entire movie. I did have some difficulty understanding the accents in just a few parts, but mostly no problem (heavy Australian accents). For me, this movie was a lot like Saving Private Ryan in that it isn't just about fighting, but also about the human side of war and the heartbreak that comes with it.",1
"i ordered this for a $5 amazon special for inspiration and tips. it's full of adds and uninteresting articles. it has some nice images. I wouldn't pay more than $5/year and i don't plan on renewing. it is, however, awesome that amazon runs specials for $5 magazines. it was worth the five bucks to give it a try.",1
"YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}.",1
"This is probably the best food sealer on the market today. I think I probably had one of the 1st Seal-a-Meal's made in the 1970's, and although I love it, this one is 100 time better. The only slight drawback is that it requires quite a bit of pressure to snap it closed, and then a lot to open it again. Other than that, it does a great job of sucking all the air out of the bag, and sealing it tight. I can store many more Seal-a-Meal bags in the freezer than I can freezing the same food in containers.",1
"I have been trying on and off for the last two and a half years to learn to programme in Java, I found this book in our local Ottakars and have been 'glued' to it ever since. The book is easy to follow and the concepts are clearly laid out. Hopefully I can keep the learning curve going to finish the book and try some projects of my own.!",1
"This cd is okay, since it's by the Backstreet Boys, but the ending tracks have no tune and the boys weren't at their best. The new ""Milennium"" is so much better!",1
"Got this phone a few years due to price mostly. Has turned out to be pretty good, especially considering that I dictate on it for a couple of hours most nights. No battery problems. Headset jack doesn't provide good volume though. Also, lots of static starting to be a problem from the phone on the phone line. To fax today successfully I had to unplug this phone, even though it is 30 feet from the fax machine.",1
"This is one of the best videos you'll find about gothic and industrial groups. ""Mephisto Walz"" and ""Christian Death"" always manage to make a great impact.",1
"I bought this for a few specific songs and when I listened to the whole CD was very pleased - great songs from real artists like Peter Gabriel, REM, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Jeff Buckley, etc. So long as you're not looking for American Idol pop-crap, then this would be for you...",1
In my opinion this is one of the finest movies ever made. Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton gave performances unmatched anywhere.,1
"I left this up to my kids to review and it clearly was not a hit. The movie is long and did not keep them glue to the screen like other zoo related movies. I have enjoyed most Matt Damon movies but I felt he was just barely ""acting"" for this movie. In the end we didn't feel this movie had any real heart.",1
"I had another squirrel guard on the 4x4 post that my feeders hang from and it did not work. This one does. No squirrel has gotten around it. However, be aware that it will not stop raccoons and manufacturer does not claim that it will - best way to get rid of them is to live trap and relocate them.",1
"This book encourages young writers to write, but seems to discourage them from actually trying to get their work published, and does not give book publishers' contact information. It instead encourages children to send work to specific children-oriented magazines, which have little or no reward/monetary return involved. There is nothing wrong with this, but the title of the book is misleading. It was not very helpful to me, who hoped as a child (however unrealistically) to get his work published in book-form.",1
"The original version of this song is still my favorite, but the remixes here are good too, just a different take. If you're a Sharon Redd fan and want to add to your collection, this would be a worthy addition.",1
Have used the GPS several times and it has gotten me where I want to go without fail. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a decent GPS for not a lot of money,1

"This machine is a replacement of my 35 yr old Viking. The instructions are excellant in my opinion, easy to thread both top and bobbin thread. I do find it much harder to thread the needle as the LED light is not asbright as needed making it harder to see the project I am sewing on also. The automatic needle threader also does not work, I think a part is missing. The selection of stitches is awesome and real easy to select. Have only sewed a few projects and overall I am pleased with its performance except for the issues stated above.",1
I have used this product for years and love it. It makes tons of lather and the cloths have two different sides depending on your needs. It takes off makeup and rinses completely. I have used others and they simply don't compare.,1
"This is a decent action movie taking place on the WWII battleship Missouri. Tommy Lee Jones does his usual good job of being a tough bad guy. The one woman on board ship (there are women in the Navy, but I guess this director is a sexist) is a Playboy Centerfold flown in with all the undercover bad guys for the Captains birthday party. Of course she strips for our viewing pleasure. She is a flake who in less than 1 minute of instruction, becomes competent enough with a machine gun to charge into battle and kill. And how in the world did Steven Seagal ever become an actor, he doesn't pull off tough guy, poses for muscle shots of which he has little, makes ""mean"" faces and generally is unappealing as the leading man, and of course he gets the girl. So just watch it for the action and Tommmy Lee Jones.",1
I was surprised by how political it was. I was also surprised by how much action it doesn't have. It talks about the 4 aces. 4 people with super powers but their deeds are often not well described or put in some past tense. I like how close to actual history it is. 4 stars for the politics cause I'm a political junkie.,1
"Boils water as advertised, but the auto-shut off switch stopped working after the first boil. Now we shut it off manually, by watching for steam comming out the spout and listening to the vigourous boiling sound. For $26, what do you expect?",1
The book takes you on a journey of the evolution of surfing and the surfing industry as seen by one man. In the end I didn't know whether to envy Mike Doyle for the care free life he leads or to feel sorry for him becuase of it. I guess both. I enjoyed every page.,1
"One of the characters in this book called Péguilin summarizes Angélique: (...)""But you...you are a spring in a desert...the dream of someone who has never dreamed...the mysteries...longing, surprise, yearning...the simplest woman in the whole world...and the most unfanthomable...the nearest and yet the farthest...the unassailable...the unforgettable.""Yes, unforgettable! I was 14 years old the first time I read the book and all the others that followed! Twenty years later here I am, still entralled by the wonderful writing of the Golons as they lead us through the court of the Sun King and the survival of Angélique, a strong woman ahead of her time! Great reading! Unforgettable, really!",1
"This is my favorite Michaels' book. The creepy old house, the mystery surrounding the old woman and her maliciousness, the ruined love affair rekindled, and the archaeological dig combine to make a great story. A reader who reviewed this book was disappointed that the ending was left up in the air; it was the perfect ending in my opinion - it literally sent chills down my spine!",1
My two year old son LOVES these blocks! They are larger than other cubes (1 3/4 in. cubed) thus allowing my son to stack them higher and higher (I think he's up to 11 or 12 blocks now). He also likes to show me the animals and letters on the blocks - a great teaching tool! I wish I had these when I was a child!,1

"I did a lot of research on which small espresso maker to buy. At first I was really frustrated with the machine. The single espresso ground holder was getting gummed up and the crema was coming out too dark with such bitter espresso. So I switched espresso beans, ground my own, and used the double espresso holder. These changes made a world of difference. For the money, I think this is a wonderful machine. I make myself a latte every morning, and it's definitely paid for itself. I agree with other reviews that the steamer is oddly placed and low to the counter. I was struggling with that until I cleared a spot on the side of my counter so it leaves room to froth.",1
These new dishes have been great. We have replaced all of our old dishes with this set. They look very nice.,1
I purchased the book out of curiosity. I currently have 2 healthy boys and am considering try again hopefully for a healthy girl. The book was easy to read and fully explains in detail the do's and don't for whatever sex your trying for. although i have not yet tried the method i would recommend reading the book. hopefully in a few months i'll try for my girl. wish me luck!,1
"They should really raise the star point system here, because anything by Mosby is worth the buy. I have the Mosby's Medical Dictionary for Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, and when I saw this book in the store, I was trying to figure out the difference, because of the color. This one offers just as many details as my previous book. This is important, because it is an easy read, and it is necessary for each household to have, for children to study off of, to the housewife that just wants to be informed. Mosby has been following me through nursing school, and anything they sell as a study aide will have a place in my home.",1
"I had an older one of these years ago and loved it. Tried several others and none compared so I kept looking, and finally found, a new one. I like being able to grill or make waffles on the same grill.",1
"I don't think I could spoil this book, because it spells it out from the very start; and I've heard it was made into a spectacular movie. This is an existential noir (I know, weird combination?) novella about two people looking for stardom in the great depression. In the hope of being discovered and the need for money they join a dance marathon. While John remains hopefully, Gloria sinks into a depression and loses all hope and eventually asked John to kill her. Because They Shoot Horses, Don't They?",1
"Great Fun, Play all your old favorites again. System is small (not much larger than a cartridge), and modern looking. Plays great, compatability is great, with good controllers, and onlysome very slight sound and video differences wtih some games. Recommended!!",1
Anyone watching this and expecting a routine crime film is in for a surprise.The film decends into increasing layers of complexity as the accused and the accusers motives rise from the plot.It's certainly a thought provoking film and one that needs to be watched at least twice.Few people will be able to unravel it on one viewing. Recommended.,1
Very confusing reviews about whether it can support an adults weight. Yes it can as long as you're not heavier than 100kgs.,1
"I have been listening to this record for over 25 years, BB:s tone on this record still strikes me as it did the first time I heard it. One of BB:s outro:s in one of the medleys on this record is a fantastic value for the price paid for this alone. You can hear a young BB play really loud and strong making his amp sing in fantastic overtones on this one, not that nice and sweet studio tone. The two artists, BB and Bobby, works very well together and if their first record together was Bobbys, this is definitely BB:s.",1
"I was surprised the tack the author took with this novel. I must admit I found myself unable to decide whether I wanted to throw the book across the room or keep reading. I kept reading and am glad I did. However, clever plot twists and novel usage of time travel and religiosity aside, the book could have been so much more. At times, just when you think the plot is going to be more Crichton-like it becomes more Left Behind-ish and you get hit over the head with blatant proselytizing. If you are able to put this aside as I was and take the story what what it was worth, you'll enjoy this book, 2 1/2 to 3 stars, if not, 1 star",1
This album is simply stunning. It is some of the most beautiful and compelling music I have ever heard. It is a MUST for any music fan.,1

"Obviously this movie was hampered by budget. The director and actors are all top notch. The story is good, but a little short. If they had a bigger budget it could have been superb. Too bad it wasn't picked by hollywood and was done foreign. It's worth watching.",1
"I have to give Mandy Moore credit for covering such an eclectic bunch of songs. She is absolutely a great singer ( although I think she's a better actress - she was great in ""Saved"" ). I don't listen to teen pop, so I've no idea how to compare this to any of her albums of original material. I have no problem with the fact that these songs are all covers versions, but I have to say the arrangements, vocal and instrumental, are too safe. They stick too close to the original versions, so it's hard to say they'd got the ""Mandy Moore"" stamp on them. It's all a bit sterile, a bit karaoke, for me to fully enjoy.",1
"Reading this book was like performing a chore you'd put off for weeks. Finishing it was rewarding because all the bits and pieces scattered around the apartment in the beginning of the story were finally packed neatly away in their proper places. The politics of international law and treaties can get pretty messy.I'll admit the story was a bit drawn out and predictable, but somehow I found myself returning to its pages wanting to hear the author's tale of heroism in the cockpit and the courtroom. I learned a thing or two about both in reading this book. The author's knowledge of aviation is what gave this flight the tailwind needed to reach its destination safely. Mission Accomplished!",1
"The last time I taught the Portrait I used Oxford's excellent 2000 edition. In 2008 this was reissued with a new Standard Book Number, but so far I've found no changes in the text. The bibliography hasn't been updated, for instance, and the typo on p. 134 of the 2000 printing (where the sentence ""Once a priest always a priest"" comes out ""Once a priest ways a priest"") is still there in 2008.But there is a change in the cover design. In 2000 this included part of Gino Severini's ""Self-Portrait,"" but in 2008 the picture has been cut further back and it's now misidentified as ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.""This edition is still excellent, but if you have a chance to buy the 2000 printing there's no point in spending more on the 2008 printing.",1
"Airplane! is back - only this time on space shuttle! It's a bit of a re-hash of the first Airplane! movie. Still there are plenty of laughs and Captain Kirk himself (William Shatner) guest stars. Almost as funny as the first movie. And remember, keep an eye on the background action as well as for the other Sci-Fi movie references. If you bought the first one then get this too!I knew it was a bad day to switch to decaff... :)",1
"How one views this movie depends, I would think, on how one generally views classic-era films. For those who enjoy them, this is one to see since it stars one of the great actresses of all time, Bette Davis. For those who prefer faster-paced, modern movies, this would not be recommended.Myself, I enjoyed Henry Stephenson and his character, ""Howard Joyce"" in here the most. He got better and better as the film went on, and for me, was the star of the film. Sadly, Stephenson died about a year after this movie came out.Most people will enjoy yet another sterling performance from Davis, who plays a shady character, ""Leslie Crosbie, "" a woman trying to get away with murder. Davis is good at playing despicable, scheming liars and she does that well here in this film.William Wyler's direction and Tony Gaudio's photography give us good atmosphere, which I why I wanted to see this on DVD after seeing a so-so VHS tape.",1
"I had never seen Bob the Builder, but it seemed popular so I bought this for our son. I think the episodes are a little corny. Maybe other dvds are different but this one really doesn't concentrate on any construction. The first episode Bob is taking dance lessons and another he ends up delivering pizzas. I thought because he was Bob the BUILDER he would mostly be building things. Not sure we will be purchasing another Bob the Builder video.",1

"The phone works but it does tend to drop out if you move around too much while you are using it. We have a lot of thicker walls in our house so it may be that we need something with a bit more power. Will be taking it on our next holiday to use in hotels with free wifi, so will see how we go. It is definitely saving us money versus having a home phone service.",1
I bought this book to engage my daughter who is doing prealgebra. The ideas are interesting but the questions tend to deal more with division and multiplication than requiring any degree of difficulty or intrigue to resolve. The book is rather short and the problems could be finished in a couple of days if the child has any degree of interest.,1

"deapans George Lazenby in the opening momemts of the 6th Bond entry. Peter Hunt's telling of the tale not only lampoons the Bond epics, it harpoons it: Bond whistling the ""Goldfinger"" theme as he's led into Draco's office the best example. But OHMSS has the classic Bond elements in tact: Great locations, the beautiful people, intense action. Telly Savalas was a natural playing a heavy and Diana Rigg radiates the screen. Englebert Humperdinck should have sang ""We Have All The Time In The World.""",1
"Loved the first series, but found the second one disappointing. It lacked the intensity of the first series, and the two stories were somehow too similar.",1
Great for Yo Gabba Gabba fans for a great price. The toddlers love it--there are so many episodes. Favorite songs are included and we discovered new favorites. Great for people like us who do not subscribe to Nick Jr.,1
"Installation was a breeze...I really hoped for better reception and transmissions. I did go to a CB shop after installation to have the Wilson 5000 Roof Top Mount CB Antenna tuned, but I still have less the desired performance. For the most part it serves the purpose of close range communication when stuck in traffic and wanting to know what the hold up is or which lane I need to be in. My biggest complaint is the lack of a RF Gain. It's not bad if you want an easy install without sacrificing space, just don't expect the same quality as the Cobra 29 LTD Classic.",1

"To my surprise, this is the first workout video that I've ever tried that I actually had FUN doing. However, it really isn't much of a workout - I didn't even break a sweat. It's still good to mix in with your other workouts on days you want something less strenuous. Another good point is the music, you get caught up in it, and the moves come more easily, I think. Dolphina is lovely and a good motivator. Camera angles leave a little to be desired, though, as previous reviews have stated - but I found that I could still figure things out after a few times through the DVD.",1
"this breadmaker is beautiful and makes bread so yummy that i can't keep up with the demand! the only problem i have found is that when i make a 2 lb. loaf and use the bread flour, it actually makes the loaf so big that it smashes into the lid and the very top doesn't get baked all the way through. if i use all purpose flour that doesn't happen. i'm going to try making a 1 1/2 lb. loaf today. the recipe book is wonderful. i tried the delayed timer the other night and had bread ready right after i dropped my daughter off at school the next morning. how fun!",1
"this is a great version of this show. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that traditionalists who are enamored with the original ""sound"" of the show may not like it. The voices in this cast are truly amazing. This is not a basic piano accompaniment, but a true rock band. Some of the songs are done in really unique styles as well such as calypso, reggae, gospel...There is much more dialogue then in other recordings of the show as well. Definately worth getting if you're a fan!",1
"Cadfael mysteries should be about sleuthing around. About telling the reader why something is important without telling them who it points to. Peters generally has us guessing up until the final moment as to the villain. But with almost all of this book being taken up by the blossoming romance between Godith and Torold and whether they escape or not, the actual murder and therefore murderer are only really touched upon in the last two chapters. Unusually, I knew the killer very early on. This was more to do with the fact that there was no-one else who could reasonably be the killer as opposed to my own detective genius. This book left me with the same feeling as watching a film billed as a Schwarzenegger Action-thriller only to find that it was all about rabbits.",1
"I did not think it was such a great book. I was wandering where is she going with this, what is her point. It is describing a woman struggling in society, trying to find her soul, something that makes her happy, and it would not be a good Dutch book if at least not some sex was involved. As I said, some parts are well written and makes this book an interesting read.",1
"I like the idea of the Roomba more than I actually liked my Roomba. The battery life was not long enough to finish cleaning a room, and it did not do a good job cleaning corners. The Roomba kept cleaning the same spots over, and over again...rather than moving onto the uncleaned parts of the floor. The self docking charge station again sounds better than it actually works. Out of the ten times that my Roomba's battery died, I think it may have made it to the docking station on it's own once - because it has to ""see"" the docking station to head towards it. I returned my Roomba Discovery...but as they keep making improvements on the Roomba, I may become interested again.",1
"I got it in '93 after listening to Catch a Bad One. At the time, Catch a bad one was the best lyrical hip hop joint I had heard. Overall the album is o.k. I immediately liked tracks 1,2,4 and 14. The cut with the Souls of Mischief grew on me after a while. Whether you buy it or not, you need to check out Catch a Bad One. If Dell would consistenly put out tracks like this, people would have to recognize his skills and give him some due. Of the music I have heard from Del, I wish my brother George was here is a better Album, but Catch a Bad One is Del's best track.",1
"In my humble opinion, The Eleventh Hour is the best Jars Of Clay album yet, even edging out their mega-popular self-titled debut. The four-song stretch of ""Revolution""-""Fly""-""I Need You""-""Silence"", each song brilliant in its own unique way, is some of the finest 16 minutes of music you'll hear. The rest of the album shines as well, especially on the melodic rock of ""Disappear"" and the poignant title song. Easily one of the best albums of 2002.",1
"System of a Down's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away. It is among my top 10 fav. albums of all time. That was the year 1998, and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness, and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity. Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about. Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls, and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry's most talented guitarists. Toxicity is the album of the year....plain and simple...nothing will top this album.Tracks of note--- Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey! ATWA, Science, Toxicity, Psycho and Ariels",1

If i could do it over again, i would have bought the 4GB SD card from Best Buy that came with a USB cable for about $25 more.",1
"Every family and every doctor should know about this book. So much suffering could be avoided. I look back at members of my family, and can now identify the ""totties"". Some had heart problems, some diabetes, some gout/arthritis, some altzheimer-like symptoms, some liver cancer, some bronze skin. I was lucky. This book was instrumental in my insisting on being genetically checked when early symptoms appeared, and before (hopefully) too much damage was done. Robin Camp, Calgary",1

"Great book for beginners! After failing the two exams initially, I bought this book after reviewing many of the recommendations from previous buyers. This book helps explain some of the more complex facts on Core & Dos/Windows in terms that I believe the average person will be able to understand. If you have no or minimal computer experience, I would use this book as an additional study supplement. This book along with Transcenders makes for a powerful combination to help you pass the the A+ exams. My only regret is that I wish I had purchased this book before taking the exams the first time.",1
"some very funny moments on this CD. i used to listen to the LP many years ago , wore it out completely. WUPS makes me smile everytime i hear it. this was the bands last chance to make it big. Only Sixteen was the hit that made them superstars. A very hard to find CD, get it while you still can.",1

"This is the alpha and omega of literature on Puccini and eliminates the need to look elsewhere. Carner's access to family history and Puccini's personal correspondence make this a definitive reference. By the same token, it is highly readable for a scholarly biography. It can be read for enjoyment as well as information -- as such, it is a good match for Puccini's art.",1
"This is a budget gate that does its job. It is basiccally a bunch of metal tubing spot welded together and painted. So if you are looking for a budget gate and looks are not that important this would be a good choice. If you are lookings for a gate to compliment your trim/woodwork, you willl probably want to spend more money and get something that is a little higher quality. It was easy to assemble and is keeping the kids out of the area that we have blocked off. I For what I am using it for I would buy this again.",1
"I prefer the Spectrum coconut oils. Because they are flavorless, they have more potential uses.",1
This book has pictures that were supposedly drawn by an artist who dissapeared before he could turn in the story. An intriguing mystery it captivates younger children and parents. The pictures are surreal and the pictures leave you hanging.,1
"This is the first book I've read by Sue-Ellen Welfonder and it problably won't be the last. I didn't really like the cover at first but then after I got into the story I really could see the model on the front being Duncan. He is a troubled man who has been bitterly betrayed by his first wife and is said to have killed her for the betrayal. He is unsure whether his son is actually his son so he weds Linnet, a woman who is reported to have the gift of sight to tell him what he needs to know.Linnet is torn from all that she has known to a far away castle by a man who weds her but only wants her for her gift. She is determined to make him love his son no matter his parentage. she also wishes for his love for herself and hopes to bring laughter and happiness back into his life.I liked this book and I would like to see a sequel about Duncan's best friend Maraduke, a man who's scars go deeper than the flesh.",1

"SANJURO reintroduces us to the hero from YOJIMBO, the invincible mercenary portrayed wonderfully by Toshiro Mifune. This movie was apparently made at the insistence of the producers, due to the overwhelming success of YOJIMBO. While amusing, the plot is contrived, often silly, and does not have the cynical power of the script of the previous film. Mifune is creditable enough in recreating the character, but it just doesn't work as well. Still and all, it's Kurosawa at work, so it remains a fun movie to watch. Just don't waste your time trying to compare it to YOJIMBO, for it won't measure up.",1
"Everyone else got it about right on their reviews. Chris' vocals have never been better and the guitarist's pumped out (arguably) their best work. But, hardly anyone, (if anyon) mentioned Matt Cameron's drum work. Absolutely phenomenal as it always was. My personal favorite drummer.",1
"I can't put this book down! I've almost missed my subway stop several times reading it. Absolutely love the view of the future, and this is more than enough to hold me over until the next book in the Daybreak series comes out.All that aside, there a number of OCR mistakes that occurred when the book was scanned into digital format, which just makes me feel like the publisher was sloppy and wanted to get the ebook out as soon as possible.",1
I'll keep it simple. In my opinion:GoodIt's in your eyes (personal favorite)That's what you saidThe times they are....All of the other songs are about average. I might not be so hard on the CD if I hadn't heard a lot better from Phil Collins before this album and after. He is one of the greatest artists of all time but this is not one of his greatest CDs.,1
"the shifting chronology, from end-of-century environmentalism and monkeywrenching do-goodism, to a bleak future, a quarter of century later where the widening ozone hole and el nino have wreaked their vengeance on the earth and its inhabitants, has the effect of bracketing a spate of touchy eco-subjects. tc boyle is too gifted as a novelist and satirist to fall prey to didactic posturing. this book is a heartfelt homage--told from the perpective of the elderly narrator whose job is taking care of a menagerie of endangered species for a mega rock star-- to an abused earth, and the people self-chosen to protect its natural treasures. the spirit of edward abbey, david brower and julia butterfly hill reside at the epicenter of this book that also questions the so called altruistic intentions of these anti-logging green activists.",1

First unit arrived and the compressor turned on once but not again. So the fan would run continuously. Amazon was great at taking it back and sending a replacement right away. The second one seems to be working fine. Lets hope it continues to do its job through the long hot Florida summer. I bought this unit to replace a 2 year old unit that died just out of its warrantee period.,1
"If you want to read a great book about the European Union and its trade policy, this is it. Actually, if you want to read any book about EU trade policy, this is it! Trading Voices explains how the Europeans plot and bargain to get their way in world trade. Unfortunately it does not talk about the current dispute between Europe and China over textiles, but the analysis could be extended to that case. I highly recommend this book.",1

"Based on a popular children's novel, THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD should entertain young children with its tale of a magical cupboard that can bring toys to life. Hal Scardino stars as young Omri who receives this magical gift from his brother. He discovers its qualities when his best friend gives him a toy Indian, and when he puts it in the cupboard, it comes to life, a tiny little live Indian (played with straight frankness by Litefoot). His friend wants a toy too so he puts the cowboy figure in and out comes a swaggering, funny David Keith as the gunslinger. Britain's popular comic Steve Coogan shows up too as a British medic that the boys use to help when both the Indian and the cowboy are wounded.Adults may find it a little too ""cutesy"" but it's heart is in the right place and Scardino is an affecting little hero. While not a classic, it is an entertaining family film.",1

"It's good to see the ESV gaining traction in the market. This is a beautifully bound compact Bible, with excellent reference notes and a remarkably complete concordance. Small enough to fit into a typical ladies purse, it's a convenient size to take on the train or bus. But the print is extremely small and takes some getting used to. It's a shame the publisher didn't make the Bible even slightly larger; I think it would have been a runaway best seller. As it stands, I can only give it 3 stars...the print is just too small.",1
I really like these diapers because 1) they have greatly reduced my son's diaper rash 2) they are better on the environment and 3) other namebrand diapers made my hands itch while these don't. I don't miss the other diapers one bit.The one thing I don't like about these is that the elastic around the legs seems to be weaker than other diapers. I've twice been holding him and been peed on because the diaper had pulled away from his leg.,1
"There are a lot of great songs on this CD, but ANDAR COMIGO is clearly the hit. I have played it many many times to the delight of my wife and teenage children. Julieta radiates tremendous joy in her rendition of this song. I love thinking of this lovely, spirited young woman singing this song on stage while. . . she plays her accordian. What a wonderful, vibrant image!",1
"For a book written in the mid-fifties, it reads like it could have happened yesterday. The book seems like a great study in 3rd person limited and hits on every kind of emotional high and low a man who is alone would probably experience. The fights scenes between him and the vampires were absolutely awesome and it felt like I was right there along with Robert Neville (the protagonist) kneeing a vampire in the face, hitting them with his car as he scurried back to the house, or shooting them in the face. Matheson has a great use of realism and while the book has some really cliche events (that I won't go into here), they still all work. In the end, you're sort of floored from the powerful combination of good writing and imagination. If you want a book that pretty much haunts you even after you have read it, then check this book out. It's worth it. And oldie but goodie that delivers.",1

"There are ALOT of good points in this season that clears alot of things up. OKay now i'm not saying they were great, but the did get the point across. A really good episode is when Faith first arrives. If your a big fan, watch Angel season 4. GREAT EPISODES. Also, if you want to buy the ""Chosen"" books, go ahead....they're not TOO bad. Just, alot of mistakes and contradictions. For instance in the first chapter, buffy says to dawn,""That's okay, I missed the heart my first time too."" then she thinks,""Just a little white lie"".....SHE Did miss the heart. You can see this in Season 2 Becoming Part one, where angel 1st sees buffy.",1

"Most of the reviews I read of this film at the time of it's theatrical release cited disappoinment in the much anticipated teaming of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Having now seen the film I ask the film's critics what they have been smoking. Nicholson and Freeman riff off each other like they've been working together for years. What were they expecting, ""Hamlet""?! Nicholson and Freeman are in their golden years and this is the perfect vehicle for the both them. Considering that the film deals with cancer patients it could have been maudlin and saccharine. ""The Bucket List"" earns every ounce of emotion and tears it engenders from the audience. Defy the critics and check out this gem of a movie.",1

"Not unlike all of Phillips' books, this book is a masterpiece of European syle and design. No detail is left unnoticed. The furniture, fabrics, antiques, architecture, artwork, and carved stone are each carefully considered and beautifully photographed. Every page is a visual delight.

it is a very interesting and useful book. The methodology that is using for automated software testing is original and i like it. I recommend the book to students in System analysis and design course and also to Application development course.,1
"This is a terrific story of courage and hope. Of endurance and determination. It's the story of the Jews who arrived in what is now Israel during the period of the British Mandate. The book continues through the end of the Israeli War of Independence at the start of 1949. There are numerous substantial quotes from many of those who reached the Promised Land, as well as several pages of photographs. For anyone interested in the history of Israel, this is simply a superb work, and Ben Wicks is to be congratulated for writing it.",1
"I am still laughing about the baby wearing that t-shirt saying: ""Damn, I'm Good"". And the woman at the motel whose head kept nodding as if she were signalling no to someone behind Taylor's head. The doorhandle at the club next to Jesus is Lord that had the woman's belly button on it. People taking care of people. For the way Ms. Kingsolver managed to pack so much tolerance, random kindness and unconditional love into one relatively short book, I will always be grateful.",1

""Spinning Around"" must be one danceable pop/disco track that will become an instant classic and a hot club favourite. Dance tunes have gotten more and more electronic of late and this is a refreshing change- somewhat back-to-the-basic sort of song. My, the infectious hook is still spinning aroung in my head as I type this. Get both singles and get them now!",1
"Modd deep has a ok album. Good enough to a 3 out of 5. Good tracks like dump with nate dogg,Real ganstaz with lil jon and . Got It Twisted Remix featuring Twista.",1
"This book is an inspiration to all mothers, especially those who are homeschooling their children. She shares her stuggles as well as her successes, with heartwarming anecdotes to which we can all relate. This book should be on the shelf of all mothers who are striving, and sometimes struggling, to give their children the best in life. It is a trusted friend in those times of dryness and discouragement. God bless Sally Clarkson for sharing herself with us.",1

"This was truly a fun movie. However, The copy I got from Amazon was apparently the ""cut"" or ""abridged"" version. It was shorter than the actual movie and had many scenes deleted. I would like to find the UNCUT or UNABRIDGED version of this movie.",1
"This is ace!There is so much new stuff ya dont know where 2 start! The ladder match is the best addition of all,coz there is so many possibilities,such as leaping off it through the Annoucers table.The SmackDown!mall is good,as the shop has everthing you need to buy an make the perfect Grappler.The Ironman match is cool,as you can change the rules to make it an Ultimate Submission Match(SEEN AT BACKLASH 2001)if you wish.The special referee mode is a hoot,as you can call it right down the middle,or pick a side!The Pay-Per-View mode makes a welcome return,enabling you to make any RAW,SmackDown! or PPV u have ever seen! All the Recent arenas have been BEAUTIFULLY created,right down to the WWF written on the padded Turnbuckles! The bottom line is that it has 65+ wrestlers,excellent game modes and lastabilty.What more does a wrestling fan need?",1
Great earring studs for my 3rd hole. i gave it 4 stars coz I was kinda expecting slightly bigger ones.,1

"I have been waiting for 3 long months to get this book and I still haven't read the book. From what I have read from the reviews here, are mainly that it was ok. But personally I think that Eldest will be a very good book.",1
"Paint job looks like real clear coat, very sharp. Detail of engine, trunk, interior, are very good. I have this model in 1/24 scale by another company also and paid a great deal more for that model. However being honest I rate and like this model much better than the other. If you have room for a 1/18 scale model go for this one.",1
"This book is well written with clear, concise language. It is presented in a logical fashion and is a much better read that the NT 4 kits. I will say however that you do need some experience or already have your NT 4 MCSE to get the most out of it. The book itself states that the intended audience are IT professionals and that a prerequisite is ""A knowledge of the fundamentals of current networking technology is required"" Unlike the NT 4 track, which you can be a newbie and get through it, I think MS has raised the bar on this one (Win2k). If you meet the requirements I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Whether or not it is sufficient to pass the exam remains to be seen.",1
"I first read ""Dog Soldiers"" when I was a teenager and was deeply impressed by it. But judging from the reviews here this is a book that you will either love or hate with no in between. So be it. Stone is probably out of reach of most mainstream readers. The only bad thing I have to say about Stone is that he sold the film rights of ""Dog Soldiers"" to the wrong people. It was made into a very terrible movie called ""Who'll Stop the Rain"" starring the highly overrated Nick Nolte.",1
I got this after noticing all the under cabinet units are kind of fugly. This makes a nice addition to the kitchen aestetically and is tall enough for nearly any can you'll need to open. Nice precision operation. Feels very well put together and rugged. I only took a star off because I'd love to have a knife sharpener feature on the back of it.,1
I thought it was a good book. It's old english which just adds color to the book. I liked it. I'll probably read it again.,1
"I had some fun and a few laughs watching this even though it wasn't a great movie.The action scenes were good and the plot had a few original twists like the boat sub-plot.I thought the sidekick stole the movie .Funny guy.One thing about the film industry though.I have to believe that half the population that is in the military is a navy seal .At least they didn't haul out the old ""best there ever was"" cliche.",1
"Although the book was at times entertaing, this book is not one of the better classic novels. The writing is often redundant and boring. Salinger, however, does portray his main character very well. In short, the book wasnt all bad, but it did not have a profound impact on me and does not stick out in my mind as a fantastic classical novel.",1
"If you're at all familiar with Satriani's work, you won't find any surprises here. The simple fact is, this album won't bring in any new listeners but will satisfy old fans. Read the other reviews and see how everyone worships this man.While I dare not call the album repetitive, it is derivative. While it thankfully does not follow the experimental wanderings of ""EoC"" none of the songs approach that album's ""Borg Sex"" or the flat out rock of ""Crystal Planet"". There isn't anything here as playful as ""Summer Song"". The ballads are the lone saving grace, but overall the whole album just feels like filler.If you're a Satch fan, you already own the album. If you're not you should check out his earlier work.",1
"This is a musical first and foremost, make no mistake; it has beautiful scenery, an amusing story line, and lots of music and dancing. If you're into that sort of thing this may well be one you'll like.I would suggest you rent it before buying as it falls into a distinct genre of movie. Several younger members of our family recommended it to us and we watched it and found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of the songs. I'll admit they did enjoy it so you may well enjoy it too; just watch it first and get a feel for what you would be buying.",1
This book is totally wonderful!!! The imagery and emotion of this book is palatable.You feel the pain of the young girl forced to become Geisha because of the demise of her poor family who live in somewhat dying fishing village.An absolutely must read before you see the movie!!!!,1
"As always, Lee Child outdoes himself, this is a great story with an excellent and twisted plot. It was interesting to meet some of his old flames and not so good friends. The legend lives on in Indiana, snipers and DA's and cops, not to forget the rookie lawyer.What I cannot understand is how Tom Cruise could be hired to act as Reacher in the movie? I mean how high are his built up shoes going to be?However that knowledge does not detract from the excellent plot at all.Look forward to the next in the series Lee!",1
"The film is nothing like the book, The Orchid Thief, but it is an amusing story with greats like Meryl Streep and Nicholas Cage and the actor, Cooper. I enjoyed the scenes set in Miami, Broward county and the Everglades, swamps I had hiked in, too. I recently became interested in orchid culture and so The Orchid Thief book was recommended. Most of it set in Miami-Dade county where I live; many of the sites and people I am familiar with. I recently met people who had had disastrous dealings with the hero, John LaRoche, and was regaled with these hilarious stories. They all encouraged me to see the film, which they loved and they felt had a very satisfying ending , to them.I purchased several copies of the DVD to give as Christmas gifts, which were much appreciaterd and enjoyed.",1
"I've enjoyed this movie since the first time I saw it. Imagine my surprise to find it out on DVD. This movie was released more recently under a different title, Leap of Faith. No idea why. But it is nice to see that those of us who do enjoy this movie are able to get it in a nicer DVD case for a much more reasonable price. All I can say is thank goodness I did some digging around and happened to discover this wonderful movie was put out more recently even if under a different title.This is a wonderful movie. Safe for the entire family. There was lessons learned by the main characters; the importance of keeping promises, of learning to trust others and standing up for what you believe in.",1
"I missed this on tv, so I bought it off amazon live. It's a good early episode in this hit show. The only complaint I have is that the show doesn't have any customed villians. Well one that is on the island. But the green arrow is only as good as his villians and he needs more radical villians. And the press would have dubbed this guy the arrow or green arrow, not the vigilante. That's what they do. Minor faults in a great show though. This is a well acted show too. Top notch.",1
"I purchased this item in the hopes of helping myself and my son to be better knot tiers. These little cards do a great job at educating in the art of the knot. The cards are thick plastic and should last a lifetime. If you are looking for a minimal tool to help boost your knot tying skills, a product which is long lasting, and for relatively cheap? Check this one out.",1
"For a teenage diary, this is extremely well written. Jim Carroll was clearly a gifted writer, and his diary brings the New York City streets of the mid-60's to life. His vivid descriptions of growing up as a street wise kid on the mean streets of the city clearly paint a picture of the period.That said, this is was NOT a fun book to read. There is much about Carroll's life in this period that is not pretty. His growing dependency on drugs is readily apparent as the book progresses, as is his willingness to do almost anything to pay for his next fix. There are graphic descriptions of both the drug use and his sexual encounters, but even so there is a sense of honesty in the account that somehow seems to be redeeming. In the end, this is a powerful glimpse into a life on the streets.",1
"this is not an easy record to like, but like it you will. in fact, you may even worship it. because it's a beast of a record: brave, stupid, baffling and brilliant. someone below compared it to the White Album, but no: it's more like an updated Exile on Main St. -- sinister undertones and all....",1

"Was trying to salvage my old Mac Mini G4 as a nifty PVR to view from my LCD TV.Turns out the recording quality is limited to VideoCD (lowest quality) due to the slower processor. This is either something I misunderstood or missed in the details. I thought HD format was the only limitation but apparently it should say DVD quality as well.Display quality at larger window viewer size or full screen gets worse which I am not sure is related. I am also using a HDMI-to-DVI cable and OS X looks fantastic compared to S-Video. So it's not the connection between Mini and TV. Might be the input to the EyeTV Hybrid.Have faith older Macs, according the Elgato's site theEyetv 250 Plusshould be better suited since the encoding is done from the device itself versus software.The Hybrid was still a great concept but unfortunately I still was disappointed that it was not ""fully compatible"" with my old Mini.",1
"Buyer/builder beware!I am so glad that I carefully studied (and did not trust) the alleged instructions, which were, by the way, no more than a few pictures on the box.For my four-foot bench, I was ""instructed"" to cut three four-foot 2 x 4s, and two 41"" 2 x 4s. In actuality, the bench requires nine four-foot 2x4s, and no other lengths. Had I followed the instructions, I would have wasted eight feet of expensive treated lumber, AND needed a second trip to the lumberyard to buy additional boards.My four hours' labor has resulted in a great bench, no thanks to the manufacturer.",1
"This disc in the series covers the Panther but the video actually provides very little detail about the Panther itself, providing only a cursory overview of the history of why the Panther was developed in a hurry and a very sketchy outline of the course of the war with video of primarily of Panthers as they make vague references to the part played by the Panther. There is very little detail on the actual development history, design and performance and nothing of significance on actual engagements.Overall a disappointment, especially compared to some of the others in the series,particularly the discs on the armored cars and the artillery.",1
"My wife and I received this coffee maker as a wedding gift five years ago. Our jobs (we work together) take us out of town for a year+ at a time, so really our coffee maker only had about 2-3 years of actual service on it. Anyway, it gave up the ghost a few months ago and it seems to be a common problem with this model judging from our research. I've contacted manufacturers for other items I felt prematurely failed and they typically will send a coupon of sorts for a small discount off the purchase of another of their products. Cuisinart just said sorry 'bout it!Otherwise, it was a good coffee maker while it lived. It was very annoying that all of the condensed water would spill down the back of the coffee maker when the cover was opened - some even speculate of this being the reason this model tends to prematurely fail. The designers obviously were aware of the issue since they designed in a little catch lip, but they just didn't make it big enough.",1
"The Churchill soup bowls are a nice size with attractive wide rims. I like them very much and will use them for a ""soup and sandwich"" supper. I had initially purchased the the set with eight place settings and the serving pieces. I am adding to it as I find good buys. I considered this a very good price for the four bowls.",1
I take this on all my trips (and I do travel often) and it has come quite in handy. I like the interior and exterior leather smoothness and there is plenty of space for all my toiletry needs. Fits into my bag well and it looks nice too so its a wonderful piece of luggage,1
"this movie started out TIGHT! I loved the begining, but it soon after lost my interest. It was really hard to follow all the characters, especially since some had many different nik-names it was hard to follow who was who.",1
"If you like Mel Brooks, get it. Wide screen and everything, despite descriptions to the alternative. It's good to be the king:)",1
"One of the things I thoroughly enjoyed about the ""In Death"" series was the wonderful range of voices the narrator gave the characters, especially the sly and distinctive voice of Peabody. I don't know WHAT the director of this recording was thinking, but Peabody sounds like mini-Eve, Mavis barely sounds like herself, Treena barely has any umph -- even the male voices are hard to tell apart. Only Roarke still sounds like himself. My first time through the series, I was really upset because I didn't know that things were going to get better.For those who are just going through the series the first time and who are as distressed as I was, it gets a little bit better with #14, ""Reunion in Death,"" and things are back to normal with #15, ""Purity in Death."" Keep the faith, folks must have given lots of feedback because the voices we came to love do come back!Aside from that, a solid story, just a really disappointing recording. Points off for that.",1
I just resently finished the book the call of the wild. It is an ok book. I liked how they had it in the dogs point of view. I would probably recomend this book to other people. I would read more of his books.,1
"Honest as it is graceful, lucid as it is lovely. Brennan's book deals with the shades of loss and reconciliation inherent in the land of the ""mind"" where identity and the ""self"" that we love when we love a daughter, sister, friend is housed and jeopardized on that accidental and foreign map of the brain trauma, coma, and finally memory loss(es) and gains. Being with Rachel visits that daughter, sister, friend, collaborative relationship that walks and tells and re-tells those stories, shared and re-made, until finally, there are paths carved well-enough that two--mothers, daughters, sisters, friends might walk together. A wonderful read.",1
"It's really long, but if you love ballet this is for you. The history and clips of the really great ballerinas are wonderful. But if you're expecting a full-length ballet, this is not it. I ordered it because it got such great reviews, but frankly I couldn't sit through it in one sitting.",1

"SanDisk makes really great SD cards, however, these 512mb's have given me the most trouble out of all of them. Most of the time, transfer is quick and easy for any file. I can put a file on the card and take it off at anytime. However, every once and a while, especially on cameras, the file almost seems to become corrupt. This problem actually happens on the card, for I have conducted numerous tests, all showing that the card messes up the file. It really only happens once in a blue moon, but when it does, it's quite a hinderance. Regaurdless of the fact, SanDisk really makes the most reliable products and at a good price, so if you are looking for a nice sized SD card, this is probably the way to go!",1
Good seller. The item was received in proper condition as described.,1
"This is great! It was a gift to my 12-year old daughter. She can use it and clean it with minimal help. It is so simple to use - just fill it with regular ice cream and the toppings you want, and out comes delicious soft ice cream. Beats running to Dairy Queen for a Blizzard all the time! The only negative thing is that not all of the ice cream comes out; however, we just eat that with a spoon after we take it apart.",1
"The Wiggle's and Steve Irwin, what more could you ask for? My son didn't like it at three but now that he's a little closer to four he gets into learning about the animals. Definately better for the four to five year old set.",1
"I finally decided to convert to Catholicism after a life long search in other faiths. I began RCIA classes in September and waited for a text to be assigned but there was no text. I was drowning in bits and pieces of information with nothing to guide my path. So I bought this book. BINGO! Or should I say AMEN! This book has enlightened me on any topic imaginable about Catholicism. It is plain and simple and positive. There is no way it will be over anyone's head. I have strongly recommended it to my convert friends as well as my Cradle Catholic friends. If you are beginning your search or have been a life-long Catholic but don't really know much about your faith, purchase Catholicism for Dummies. It will enlighten you!",1

Not all slow, dreamy stuff though -- good for that drive through your favorite wasteland, be it natural or industrial.For guys who like Lisa Germano's stuff, you'll love this.

"I belong to a book exchange and exchanged this book for ""The Child Whisperer"" which I personally feel is one of the best and simplest parenting books around. Like ""The Child Whisperer"", ""The Happiest Child on the Block"" skips the high brow theory and gets right into practical application of sound and proven techniques. If you are looking for a no-nonsense approach to improving your relationship with your toddler, buy this book. Oh, buy ""The Child Whisperer"" too and you will have two great books for your resource shelf or to exchange with others.",1
"""On Mother Brown's Doorstep"" is the fouth book in the Adams series. Much of the this book is about the up coming wedding of Sammy Adams and Suzie Brown. Also we meet more of Suzie's family including Will Brown who is back from India due to health reasons and while home he meet Annie Ford and her family. But things are not good in Walworth, with three missing girls.While I liked ""On Mother Brown's Doorstep"" the whole substory of the missing girls really was not needed. Also I think that the Polly Simms character could be used better. But, thisreview should not turn people off to reading a great series.",1

The greatest thing about this movie is you see Sean Connery before he had his heavy signature voice. The movie is a little heavy for young kids. My 6 year-old couldn't keep his mind on it.,1
"We need more animated films like this today. I remember seeing this on TV during my pre-teen years, I think, and was quite impressed with its realism, symbolism and message. I remember being amazed that a ""cartoon"" could convey so much social relevence. Keep in mind that I was raised in the Roadrunner/Woody Woodpecker era, which offered nothing but mindless comic violence and guffaws, which are good, but ... I would recommend parents, especially parents these days, to watch this show with their children and talk about it afterward. It's very good.",1

"I purchased this item based on my experience with Madame Alexander products over the past 30 + years. I purchased it for my daughter-in-law who is quite a fanatical fan of Tink. I looked the doll over before wrapping it and found it delightful. My daughter-in-law said she felt likewise. It is such good quality. The dolls by nature are not cuddley/cuddly (?) so the essence of ""fairy-like"" is missing -- you know, the lithe and lovely and flighty and flitty characteristics we imagine belong to fairies. But then again I am not so sure about a stuffed Tink . . . ?I think this is a wonderful product. NOT a toddler doll. It is a collectible doll to be cherished and looked at with both parent/adult and child then put away again for another time.",1

"Keith creates a world of violence and chaos, with a likeable young hero stranded on a planet torn by civil war. Characters are well drawn for an action story. There are well drawn male and female characters.I felt this book was more consistently interesting and better paced than Operation Excaliber, the only other of Keith's novels that I have read.For those who've enjoyed Decision at Thunder Rift, there are several other Battletech books which continue the adventures of the likeable young hero",1

"Overall great coffee maker. Needed to find a replacement for my 10 year old Mr. Coffee, and chose to go with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.-Nice design, the matte black finish disguises smudges and water spots.- Great cup-of-joe, everytime. Then again i've had the same results from a $9 Proctor Silex at the office. Not to mention i use premium Kona coffee from Hawaii.- Auto features are easy to use and program.- I concur with a previous review, in that the water resevoir has a small opening and is oddly placed. Pour carefully.- It comes with a water filter....cool.- Fork down an additional $10 for the replacement Gold Filter Basket (#4), it's worth it's weight in gold....pun intended.- My parents have been happy using the same machine over the past year.",1
"This was my first webcam, and I thought it was nice. It'll freeze every great once in awhile, but usually ill just shut it off for a sec and then it's fine. It's not bad for $20, and the picture quality isn't bad either. It's not amazing, but it's a good value for the price.",1
Goodkind really starts this series off in a great way. I have read the whole series and recently decided to re-read and Wizard's First Rule is my favorite of them all. Even if you never read the whole series this is good as a stand alone book.,1
"The play Othello is rest in modern times with the high school ""prep"" star ""Odin"" as Othello. His teammate and the coach's son has the Iago role of a scheming and evil ""friend"". He turns the main characters against each otherby ""playing"" them with lies and using a stolen handkerchief his girl friend obtains. The movie like the play was hard for me to watch. Half way through I realized it was Othello in modern drag and it became easier, since I knew it was a love gone wrong tragedy. The Shakespeare play has dialog by Iago that makes his motivations clearer than the nice bright high school boy gone wrong in this movie. The movie has basketball, drugs and guns added, but results are pretty much the same.The acting is pretty good actually, but intense introspectivedialog that should be there seems left out to me.the results are pretty much the same",1

If there was a way to vote for 10 stars this book would definitely get it. I stumbled upon Ms. Roby's writing through my book club and haven't been able to stop reading her since. Her writing is so filled with depth of each and every character you feel like you know them personally! This is one of the best books I've read so far this year. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that likes a good read. Make sure you pick up Casting the First Stone to really get the background of Rev. Black -- another EXCELLENT book!,1
"This slim volume lists all types of markets by the day of the week or month and location. There's also usually a contact number for more information. If you're going to be in Italy during the first weekend of the month, or the second Tuesday, say, you can check the listings for that time period. There are a few blank pages at the end of the book to write your own personal market notes!No doubt people will need local maps and/or guidebooks to help locate the markets; this book will work best in addition to other guidebooks - not as a replacement.",1

"Why, Universal ... WHY? Granted, this isn't a cinematic classic but it's a good time! I've loved this movie ever since I was a little kid and was hoping for so much more out of a special edition. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll actually purchase this. I'm fortunate to own one of the OOP copies (stumbled across it in a used CD store for $5 no less) and it seems like Universal isn't giving me a really good reason why I should buy this particular edition.I gave it four stars simply because I love the movie.",1
"A few have been critical of On the Road for the absence of a point. Devotees have responded by saying that that criticism misses the point precisely. My advice would be to look for the cumulative effect. Compared with great literature On the Road is lacking, but it was not intended to be. Rather, examine On the Road as a slice of life. Ideally, your experience reading On the Road would be life-changing, but each of us is at different stages of life and therefore, we cannot experience it uniformly. Everyone should read Kerouac, to get a glimpse of history and maybe to understand a generation, another time. Recommended for anyone high school and up.",1
"I'll keep this review short and simple. If you like/love Pink Floyd, then you probably like/love Dark Side, and Pink Floyd is great in concert (at least I think so), so to put those together is enough to buy Pulse on its own. But Pulse offers so much more than that, with other great concert recordings. Pick it up if you enjoy hearing them live (and if you like them live, you really should get all of their live albums).",1

"This is a truly enchanting book. Yes, the patterns need adjusting to fit different size teddies, but that should not be much of a problem for anybody who has done knitting beyond scarves. The patterns are given by count, and where there might not be a ready count it's easy to count out the pattern on the graph. Since I crochet my own teddy bears and then dress them in different outfits, adjusting any pattern is a must for me and not a problem. The sweaters knit up easy in terms of pattern. I started on the squirrel sweater on the front page last night but had to modify the sweater to fit my bear, and I am using set-in sleeves. The squirrel came out perfect, love this book!",1
"for the price i cant complain too much, but it doesnt fit my face very well. im not a big guy, 5' 8"", 160lb, and its a pretty tight fit.the open portion goes pretty wide, but again, you cant expect a perfect fitting high quality anything for $5",1
The valslide is difficult yet effective workout. You must be careful to keep the right posture in the different exercises in order to avoid working the wrong muscle group for the intended exercise.,1
"I've only just gotten back into reading sci-fi books, and I have to say that this was an interesting story. The characters lead a sad life, but of course all is vindicated in the end. The plot took a twist after they landed on ""the planet"" (one that I wasn't expecting, I might add), then it became somewhat political, but I still enjoyed it. I'll more than likely read the other books that are part of the series.",1
"This was by far, the best book in the Chronicles of Prydain, with the battles rising higher as the final encounter between the dark lord arises, as Taran faces his fears and learns to control them and find a solid reason to why he has been chosen to be the realm's legendary king--the High King. This was my favorite because of all the action that escalated to a brutal war, the events throughout the book are excruciating up until the end, which I have to say, ended very well and made me sooo sad because this was the very last book! Lloyd Alexander is a wizard with words and worlds, making readers excited to enter his magical realm, and mourn when it is time to leave. This book gains my 100% approval of good book you HAVE to read before you die!!!",1
Fun to reminisce with Carol and friends! Awesome collection of videos really enjoyed it a lot. Must buy for CB fans everywhere,1
"This is what remaserting should be about. A great album with much cleaner, transparent sound quality. Add a few interesting extra tracks into the pot to make a must buy for ELO fans. This album was great in it's time and stands up well for me. I am a big Jeff Lynne fan and love ELO.",1
"Covers very basic material- most of which could be read from the Maya API help anyway. What I was expecting was a book written in the ""Game programming GEMS"" style, where multiple case studies are taken up and solved using MEL (as in Stripnis's book) or MAYA API. What we get is some simple examples, better resources can be found on the web. The API section is written better than the MEL section. This opinion is from a programmers standpoint,artists impression may differ.",1
I was disappinted with this movie because it was only a small part of the book and Michelangelo's life. There was a lot of interesting parts left out in order to make the entire movie about the painting of the Sistine Chapel.,1
"Some may say this, GF's second record, is a musically simplistic piece of work. But no one ever listened to Grand Funk for complexity. For a raw, burning power trio sound, this record is hard to beat. Lots of fun, funky rock 'n' roll and lots of sex in the first four tunes. The record gets heavier after that, including the longer concert staples In Need and Inside Looking Out, Mark Farner's climactic hard edged guitar playing on display. Only one throw-away tune: I just never cared for Paranoid. If you're looking for depth and complex musical layers, buy some Pink Floyd or Deep Purple. If you're looking to party and nothing else, put on this record.",1
"This product was as advertised. It arrived in a timely fashion, and in perfect condition. Instructions were easy to follow and assembly uncomplicated. It is exactly the aid to a disabled person that we had hoped for. Not as elegant compared to some others, but every bit excellent, and more, for the purpose for which it was employed. Highly satisfied with purchase.",1
"No one is less of a Meg Ryan fan than I. She is, entirely too cutsie for my taste. Not that she's bad to look at mind you. But in this film she is about as sexy, real, and sympathetic as possible. Her performance was perfect for the part.Dennis Quaid gives his finest performance ever as the tormented son of James Caan.It's pretty easy to see where the film is headed fairly early in the picture but it's so well acted and directed that it's well worth the price of admission. The film is extremely character driven including an incredibly cheap yet sexy Gwyneth Paltrow.The movie has much to say about relationships, loyalty, selfishness and the price paid because of them.",1
"That is what I remember, the main theme song, which is very cool. The series, however, is very corny. The rest of the music used in the show is laughable 70's Hollywood interpretations of real 70's pop music. The outfits these guys wear made me laugh too, yeah - people really wore stuff like lime green ascots with green shirts in the 70's. Curtis' gloves were one of show's trademarks.The plots are very simple: two rich playboys chase some woman around and get into big trouble for their efforts.What is really amazing is how television has'nt changed that much. The Persuaders is fun to watch, Curtis and Moore work well together and the corny dialog is better than what passes for good dialog on cop shows today.Its worth a look at least once.",1
"I love the story itself being part of Dumas' ""The Marie Antoinette Romances"". The book however is like 8""x 11"" and with carpal tunnel, that makes it a little hard on my hands.",1
Stephanie needs some work because nobody is skipping out on bail.. Then her mom drafts her in to looking for her Uncle Leon who disappeared while running errands. She also starts taking on jobs working for Ranger. Another fun installment in the series,1
I am a prime member and thought it to be a little strange that a movie this old is not included in the prime pkg. The reason for the 3 stars is that the HD version was $3.99 and froze several times through viewing (on a clear day).,1
This book contains nothing but full page reproductions of Bill Mauldin's cartoons drawn during WWII. This is a fantastic addition to any WWII buff's collection. Snap this one up quickly!,1
"The 1993 Survivor Series was the first and only WWF pay-per-view held in the historic Boston Garden. It was also the first time I attended a WWF pay-per-view. After some negative feedback from the previous year's event, the WWF wisely returned to the winning formula of four-on-four elimination tag action.The 1993 series saw The Macho Man entering as a substitution for Mr. Perfect, another chapter in the Bret Hart-Shawn Michaels feud, the beginning of the Bret vs. Owen feud, and the elustrious moments where Lex Luger joined up with Santa Claus(?). We also got to see the Bushwackers and Men On A Mission dressed up like Doink The Clown and The Heavenly Bodies win the Smoky Mountain Tag Team Title.At the time, this was one of my favorite PPV's but time has not done it justice. Today's fans may not enjoy it as much but it was still a hell of a show.",1
"Like everybody else is commenting, go out and buy the first one. After listening to the first one you'll be very tempted to buy this one, but try to borrow it first and see if you like it. Had I listened to it before purchasing it I may not have brought it. It's not a bad album though, but some songs are too long and repetitive and I'm not much into techno.. I guess that's why I liked the first one so much, it didn't have as much techno. Well, this one is really cool too. They are the best soundtracks to relax and go to bed with. I highly recommend the first one before getting this one though. You won't have any regrets.",1
"Very believable characters and settings and events. I became involved with the storyline and immediately ordered Season 2. I can't wait for the start of Season 3. Acting is superb, costumes are delightful Downton is a character in its own right. Loved it!",1
"We purchased this lamp to use as a work light for doing crafts, reading, etc. Its main virtues are that it has halogen bulbs that can be oriented and the brightness can be adjusted. The lamp is very elegant and made of good materials. It came in a large box but needed to be assembled. We never could find the instructions but eventually figured out how to assemble it. The one problem was that where the top part fit into the main stand we should have placed a large screw; however, the hole was misshaped so we could not insert the screw. This does not affect the function of the lamp as long as you are not in the habit of carrying it around by the top. If you do the bottom might fall off. Overall, this lamp seems to be a good value. Especially when compared to the really junky lamps out there.",1
The book is in fairly good condition. few pen underlines at the end pages. this almost looks like a new one. The book store had also promised of 90 days warranty. everything is good and book is in good condition as stated in their review.My only complaint is it took a week longer than promised delivery date. but the book delivered was worth of waiting.thank you!,1
"I enjoyed this book I thought it was light and easy to read. I enjoyed Cooper, Sadie, and Lulu (?) I think if it were not for their little antics this book would have been rather dull",1
"I love that this baby food is just three simple ingredients: organic green beans, water, and organic brown rice. Some of the Earth's Best varieties contain a lot of fruit in order to make them sweeter, but this one does not. My baby loves the flavor and always finishes the entire jar in one sitting.",1
"I thought the book was well written and it probably works for some people, but the recipes were not realistically possible for someone like myself. I work and go to school, so I don't have time to cook any of those meals. My meals are on the go, so I need something that I can make put in a bag and not require heating it up. Have any suggestions?",1
"All I do with it is listen to mp3s. It works. The skip mechanism is a little touchy since the skip wheel is also the select button if pushed but I do not skip more than a few times a day so it doesn't bother me. The menu is a little more complicated than some others I have used but it has everything I need and only takes a few more minutes to learn(if you do not use the manual).-Best: it does play music with good sound, has an easily readible display, is extremely light and a good shape(simular to a pack of gum), and pretty good battery life( for a single AAA battery). Overall I am very happy with my purchase.",1
"The Naked Ape was certainly an important book for its time, as it helped people think about themselves and their fellow humans in a different light. However, reading the book about 45 years after it was first published, its age begins to show, with some old-fashioned chauvinist ideas creeping in, an incredibly biased point of view towards the European/American model of society as the only one that matters; and a surprising amount of false and outdated psychological ideas ascribed to people (surprising given that the premise of the book is that we are far closer to our animal nature than we care to admit).I would still recommend reading The Naked Ape just because it is an important milestone in the history of cultural anthropology/evolution, but would take a lot of the conclusions with a healthy dose of skepticism. A much better book on the same subject is Robert Wright's ""The Moral Animal Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology"".",1
Purchased for a 2010 Camaro. 600mi later still no lights or error codes. Make sure to follow directions and you'll be good.,1
"I really enjoyed Dun's first novel, ""Necessary Evil,"" and was anxiously awaiting publication of his second, ""At the Edge."" Once again, he has created two fascinating main characters, established an unrelenting pace which keeps the reader glued to the story for hours. Dan is a timber lawyer, bit of a tough guy, born to an Oregon ranching family. He encounters Maria, an environmental attorney, who was born to wealth and conservatism, but was reborn to become a populist, environmentalist, democrat. These unlikely allies are thrown together by an intriguing cast of evil doers. Dun's trademark chases are present in abundance and he has added a child to the mix, Nate. Nate brings some warmth and humor to an action packed thriller with a good romantic angle. Adventure thriller fans will love this one. An absolute must read!!!!",1
"I liked the books better then the movie.I watched it, but would not watch it more thenthe one time.",1
"I purchased this book to use as an addendum to a meditation and mindfulness group I facilitate for elementary school aged children at a residential treatment facility. I read the book to my group and incorporated it into a discussion about the behaviors focused upon in the book. The children were very attentive while reading them the book. They loved the whimsical illustrations that effectively illustrate the written material. The content is simple, straightforward and yet, conveys the benefits of meditation in terms that a child can easily grasp. I have purchased other books that refelct these same concepts, but feel that the content and illustrations of this one are more readily understood by children. The focus of relating to meditation practive via a ""peaceful piggy"" is intriguing to them and keeps their attention. I now intend to research the other books offered in this series to see if they would be as useful to me as this one.",1
"I thought the movie was OK and the Blu-Ray transfer is good but nothing spectacular about either. The humor just seemed really uneven, like the movie was relying more on Jack Black being Jack Black than actually having a good, funny script.",1
"My 9 month old daughter has sat spellbound by the Wiggles since she was about 10 weeks old. If we ever needed her to sit in one place for an hour, forget about teething pain or other boo-boos, all we've ever had to do was pop on a Wiggles DVD and all is forgotten...except with this particular DVD.I don't know if she's a bit baffled with the Crocodile Hunter popping up every 2 seconds (I can tell she's thinking, ""Who IS this guy?!""). Or perhaps she doesn't like it as much because all of the songs and skits take place outdoors and there aren't any brightly colored studio sets.She watches it, but she's not as interested in this one as her other Wiggles DVDs. ""Woo-Hoo Wiggly Grimlins"" and ""Top of the Tots"" are by far her favorites.",1
"This book only shows how to identify the type of block and known names. It does not tell any history, except where the name came from (like a publication). I was hoping this would be about the folklore associated with the block names (like what Kansas Troubles and Bachelor's Puzzle mean). Although I know the stories collected about quilt blocks would be purely speculation, it would be fun to read a book about collected histories.",1
This will keep my pipes from freezing and it isn't very expensive. I plan to use it at home and on vacation property. Buy it. It can be adapted to blow out at hose bib connections too. It will save on repairs.,1
"The insoles are very comfy so if you are looking for general support you should buy them. I took a star off because I was expecting there to be more arch support. There was some, but not enough for me to keep using them.",1
"Had I known this was a shelcore product when ordering it, I would not have let my wife purchase it. Typically, thay have very poor quality products.But truth be told, my son (14 months old) Loves to push this thing around.particularly outside. it is far heavier near the front than the rear so whenever he meets a line on the sidewalk, the walker gets stuck.Then he has to put really hard to ""unstick"" it...and of course, more often than not, it goes flying away from him and he stumbles forward, sometimes falling down.Really it needs bigger wheels and a center of mass more toward the rear of the walker. Functionally its ok and entertaining for the boy.",1
The soundscapes Steve Roach creates on Dreamtime Return are out of this world. They'll grab you instantly and by the time this double-disc set comes to an end you'll be amazed and stunned by it. This is Roach in his finest hour and it's definitely the finest hour of ambient music. This is a must have for every ambient music fan....,1
In Hatchet there is a boy named Brian Robeson who is 13 years old riding in a airplane. The plane crashes and Brian has to survive in the wilderness. He runs into a little bit of trouble. ALL he has to survive with is a hatchet. It's a good survival book.,1
"Okay, this is, hands-down, Sonic's GREATEST 16-bit adventure EVER! (SCD's Special Stages still remain a favorite!) Q-Sound Stereo music (which completely topples anything that the Genesis/Mega Drive could ever reach!), 7 awesome-looking Zones, a new time-travel system, and cool new characters and moves make this Sonic's best old-school quest EVER!(Is OBSESSED with Spencer Nilsen's ""Sonic Boom"")P.S. This is the Sega CD/Mega CD version. If you have the PC version and are trying to run it on Windows XP, don't try it. THE PC VERSION OF ""Sonic the Hedgehog CD"" WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS XP!Just so you know. Ok, bye!",1
One of their best ! I love this album. A must have for blink fans out there! Buy this one !,1
"Contrary to a previous review, many of these themes are remakes.Just to name a few I Love Lucy, Dragnet, The Honeymooners, Alfred Hitchcock,Bewitched. But there are several that are original, such as Flinstones, Adams Family, Gilligans Island, Monkees, Brady Bunch, Six Feet under, and a few more. So this comp is touch and go. I have been collecting themes for 35 years, and I have never found a comp with ALL ORIGINAL THEMES.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, watched the extras and immediately wanted to watch it all again. The beauty of the cinematography; the universality of the message; and the abundance of strengths of the Diaspora, particularly the women was beautiful. I especially enjoyed the subtle and not so subtle images of spirituality. Highly recommended.",1
"This is one of those movies that seems complicated enough, but is surprisingly easy to follow. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, a 17-year-old high school student whose best buddy is Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). One night, Brown introduces Marty to something extraordinary: a time machine made from a DeLorean. Soon, Marty is thrust back into the 50s and finds himself hooking his parents up on their first date. But just around the corner is bully Biff Tannen. This incredible film launched an awesome trilogy that has finally hit DVD. It remains director Robert Zemeckis' best work.",1
"The case does a good job of protecting filters, but it can be little unwieldy to insert and remove them because of the overlapping flap-style cover.",1
"I bought this to help my my pregnancy nausea. I think the taste of them make my nausea worse! I would not consider these candy, they are not very tasty. More like pieces of slightly sweetened ginger. Maybe I was expecting too much. Does tasty ginger exist?",1
"Noa has a gorgeous voice that has no comparison! Her authentic Israeli sound is one you will definitely want to listen to more than once! I bought her CD not knowing what to expect, and I was completely blown away-- she makes her music a joy to listen to! Even if you don't speak Hebrew, these awesome lyrics are given to you! I will always rate this CD as ""5-star""!!! Everyone needs to buy this GREAT CD!!!",1
I thought that the book Night was a very good book in fact it was one of the best books I have ever read. I didn't know much about the Holocaust but after reading the book Night I learned a lot about it. I really like the parts in the book were he is about to give up and die but he says that he would live for his dad. So thats why I rated this book a 4.,1
"As I listened to this version of the album, many of the songs seemed to be of inferior quality in comparison with the songs on the original version of this album. Secondly, rather than having to hear twenty minutes of Jonathan King's egotistical claptrap, I would have preferred to hear an interview of the musicians in the band. Dont bother buying this version. Instead buy the original album with the black cover with gold lettering!",1
While I can't attest to it's fat burning capabilities it definitely helps with muscle fatigue and soreness. If I have any complaints is that I'm taking 9 pills a day and it burns through the bottle in no time.,1
This book was pretty spot on with recommending movies for certain times in your life. It also gave me a long list of movies that I need to watch. The reviews are humorous and insightful. Great selection across a wide time span.,1
"out of their entire collection, this single outruns all the other full albums with the mind-blowing song. the live tracks just add to the great song that the band created.",1
"Since John Huston's ""The Bible"" no one in the secular movie world really attempted to film this magnificent story from the greatest bestseller of all times, and this movie does a masterful job of it, much better than its predecessor. It was interesting to note that there were scenes cut from the American version that were shown in the European version and vice versa. Aside from that, this makes an excellent Bible Study tool, as, poetic license aside, you see visually what you have read so often and learn to think over your biblical text more. The key is to remember that this movie isn't authoritative, but the Bible is. Enjoy!",1
"Still derivative 80s pop-metal, but marginally better than Animalize. Buy only if you're a true-blue KISS fan.",1
"My son is 17 months and loves this book. We have the sign language dvd titled ""my baby can talk"" by baby hands and this book is featured and read for the ""sign"" for book. I thought it might help him make a better connection if he had the book also. It is very short. However, That is about all I have time to read before he is off running.",1
"This is a beautiful pendant. Well made, and well defined. Goes well with almost all of the silver/cubic zirconia earrings.",1
"Documentation makes it seem that there should be an included Watch Holding Vise, I just use my other hand. I'm glad I made the purchase.",1
"This album is pretty good. Britney Spears has been one of the most talked about teen pop icons in the last year, and deservedly so. She hit No. 1 with ""...Baby, One More Time,"" and ""(You Drive Me)Crazy,"" ""Sometimes,"" and ""Born To Make You Happy."" Britney is a pretty cute little girl for what she's doing: teen fluff pop that we kids her age can relate to. What do you expect? Mozart? Jewel? I don't think so. I do admit though, Britney should get better vocal lessons or NOT sing ballads because ""Sometimes,"" (I 'sometimes' wonder how this ever became a hit), and ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" remain unlistenable. However, I thought that ""Born To Make You Happy,"" and ""E-Mail My Heart"" were good, despite such a lurid title for the latter. Actually, when you think about it, if you're between the ages of 12 and 16, you probably should get this CD, if you're a boy or a girl, because these are catchy tunes that any pop fan will enjoy.",1
"I liked this book as a series of related short stories. I liked how it provieds some additional background about what's going on in this new time line. It was nice to see how things are chaning in the area around Grantville. I emjoyed reading this, even though most of the writers aren't at the same level as Flint. However, I think the next book in the series from Flint is long over do.",1
TWO FOR YOU GLENN COCO YOU GO GLENN COCO!!! AND NONE FOR GRETCHEN WIENERS! Lol this movie never gets old.,1
"This was a good book to read because we're new parents. I was hoping that there was going to be more information than just the 5-6 tips to making out baby happy, but the 1 or 2 things I hadn't heard of where worth learning and trying. We do really have one of the happiest babies, which isn't entirely because of the steps we used from this book. It was worth the read.",1
"Having read the excellent book on which this film was based, I was apprehensive about what Hollywood might do to distort it. Author Bissinger addressed the topic of racism in that book, and my fear was that this would be the sole theme focused on by the film makers. However, to their credit, they made the movie about much more than that -- and when they did touch on the topic, they did so fairly even-handedly, showing from the comments made by some Carter players that racism is a two-sided coin.This movie is a powerful contrast with ""Varsity Blues"". That was an entirely forgettable movie because it dealt with fictional characters in cliched situations. ""Friday Night Lights"", based on true events, portraying real people at real Texas high schools, and showing the agony and ecstasy of the run for the state championship, was a memorable film.",1
"It has some episodes that aren't on other collections, but it also had lots of areas where the dvd would freeze, could have been just my copy.Why can't they just start at season one?",1
"Particularly if it's coming out of the office budget, I highly recommend this stapler for anyone who does a lot of stapling or who regularly needs to staple large documents. While I use the palm of my hand, the stapler does most of the work.The package does include 1000 high-capacity staples, but it should be noted that only half are 65-sheet capacity. The other half are for up to 30 sheets, according to the box.This stapler does also accommodate ""standard"" staples, but since they're shorter will not hold a big document securely.Because of the power of this stapler, someone who isn't very strong could hurt themselves playing with this, and I would not keep it around a home office if children--even those not so small--are around. It is dangerous.",1
"My 8 year old loved it; cute lizards revolving around the face. Would be nice if the band actually had a clasp instead of just sliding through a metal slider with teeth, doesn't hold very well and I can see it shredding soon, but so far so good.",1
"I bought this mouse for cheap, at $19.97 from a retail store. My initial thought was, ""Why so cheap? There has to be something wrong with it."" I was wrong. This is a beautifully crafted mouse, both visually and functionally. Works great. Although it only scans at 1500 frames, while other newer mice scan at 6000 frames, you can't tell the difference. Its just numbers. I play games as well as use it for Design and Multimedia creation. And it works fine. The blue scroll-light, as well as the perfect color of the body, sold me right away. I was willing to take the chance at such a good price.Evidently, there was no ""chance"" to be taken, because it works wonderfully! Why IBM discontinued production of the mouse, we will never know. IBM should have had Logitech and Microsoft running for cover! If you have a silver-, black- or grey-colored case and/or keybooard, buy this mouse now!! Note: Works best with a mousepad due to surface-consistency.",1
I love Tom and Jerry. I used to watch these all the time. I used to read their books all the time. I am so glad that there is something out there that has allowed me to relive my childhood. I think any adult and child should have the plesure to watch these classic cartoons. They are a little over the top so the children should be a little older when they are allowed to watch.,1
"Fox did a brilliant job in restoring Drums Along the Mohawk for DVD, with one small, annoying exception ... the 20th Century Fox trademark is from a much later era, perhaps the 1960s or 1970s. They also did this with the DVD restoration for Leave Her to Heaven. It would have been simple enough to use the original.",1

"This has got to be the best quartet to hit the studio ever!! I absolutely loved the song Damn Yankees. Jack and Tommy are fabulous on the song ""Bad Reputation"". The way their vocals bounce off of each other is...(I'm speechless).",1
"This thing works just as advertised with very bright flashing LEDs that you can see from every angle. The only problem is that it's bulky (about 5 cm in diameter, somewhere between the size of a ping pong ball and a small tangerine). My dog absolutely hates it... it hangs down from the collar and bounces all over the place when he runs (or even walks). The strobe is also very disorienting for him, since it is in his inferior visual field. It's not very heavy, but it is heavy enough that he feels it weighing him down. If you have a large dog (>60 pounds), or if you dog is insensitive to bulky things around his/her neck, this may work just fine. Otherwise I would recommend a smaller clip on light. We now use the Flashing Strobe Safety Light, which also has an always-on function. It is not visible from every angle, but it is light (although the clip is very cheap and will probably break soon).",1
"This thing works perfectly... a very satisfying click noise with each tally, seems durable, easy to reset, etc.",1
"This DVD is fantastic! It has everything on it I had hoped for. I was a little concerned that the copy I purchased would not have the ""Goddess of Spring"" feature it claimed to have, and so I was delighted when it did. The person who sold it to me was very prompt about shipping the DVD and answering my e-mails. I greatly appreciate the effort put in to selling me this item. As a life-long fan of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" I am very happy with this purchase. I'm sure any other ""Snow White"" fan will be too.",1
I bought this to spread on top of my breakfast cereal but discovered that you can eat it by the spoonful. It tastes nutty and is absolutely delicious. High in protein and iron so you're off to a good start including this in your breakfast.,1
"Andy Samberg is great,but Adam Sandler and that stupid voice he does is annoying. The movie was a little predictable. It did have some funny parts. I'd probably watch it again.",1

"This book is an excellent tool for one learing to cope without being dependent. Daily meditations/guidance is organized chronologically. The only bad comment I can male is that there is no way to look up a specific topic which is immediately pressing. But, this book is worth the $ to the ones who need guidance.",1
"I have the DVD and purchased this blu-ray because i really like this movie. The sound is better, but the image is not that great. The upconvertion DVD image is almost equal.",1
"I recently went to see Mamma Mia on Broadway. The thin and contrived plot is nothing more than an excuse to sing about 30 Abba songs -- as if an excuse were needed. Still, the musical did remind me again that beyond the buoyant pop sounds always instantly identifiable with Abba, the group -- even as relationships were falling apart -- had some insightful things to say lyrically about relationships and the pain of their end even as that end is inevitable. So, all these years after the group imploded, it's clear to me at least that Abba was more than bubble gum. And they are always welcome to make the occasional shuffle visit to my music player.",1

"While I believe positive thinking definitely has value, I'm not a big Law of Attraction person. That being said, I still found this book useful. As you've already seen in other reviews, this short book is summarized in three steps for achieving things:1) Write down exactly what you want.2) Think about it as much as you can as if it's already achieved.3) Don't talk to anyone about it until you have real-world results to share.I believe that these simple steps do help with making your dreams a reality, especially not talking about it until it's actually happening. I know too many people that do nothing but talk to others about their grandiose plans, but fail to take effective action on them. I've always been the opposite; I don't say anything to anyone about budding projects (except for maybe my wife and best friends) until they're actually up and running...and even then I'm not one to talk much about it.",1
This is a really nice album for a first album listener.This album will inspire you to go and purchase more albums of herand compare the difference of which you most find interesting.Every album has a different touch.I highly recommend to start off with this one then go to the other ones.It is a worth a trybecause this album happen to be one of her well known albums inthe whole world.,1

"We bought this video monitor after our daughter turned one. I didn't think I would need it with having the voice monitor, but it was nice to see what she was doing at bed times.I could also see when she woke up without opening the door and disturbing her.(door closed due to cat)We thought it was great. I like the easy on and off video button at the top and the sound is very clear and loud. It also lit up the crib at night which was kind of nice also. It was just enough light, like a nite lite. The down fall was the clicking noise constantly. So we decided to try the Safety 1st brand($50 more)Wow the picture was sooo much clearer. No constant clicking. Not as easy to switch video off and the sound is not as loud as I would like it to be but for a better picture it's worth paying a little more, plus you have a tv to boot.",1
We wanted a switch and siding with our train set. I like the waythe track fits and stays together.,1
"Another Great author, Guy Gavriel Kay gives this book a magical quality that won't let readers put it down. A novel filled with magic, betrayal, war, love, and fantasy! Certainly one of the best books of all time!",1
What a great album and an unbelievable singer. I can't say enough about how amazing this guy is. He's truely in a league way above many of today's 'hot' singers. Richard is unfortunately very underated. There's not a bad song on this entire album. I love it.,1
Just one thought this toy is not like a nerf toy it is made of hard rubber and is designed to be thrown underwater. I teach SCUBA & snorkeling classes. Most of my students (adults & children) love tossing the toypedo around. By it self it has limited educational value but it is an excellent teaching aid for Snorkeling and SCUBA.,1
"I needed to teach myself GarageBand and fast. I was in the middle of editing a podcast with Audacity, and it wasn't working for me. GarageBand saved the day--and this book saved it even more. I picked this book up from the library to check it out ... then quickly ordered a copy for myself. It's easy to use, easy to understand, and is a great quick reference tool.",1
"This is the first Iris Johansen book I have read and I was not really impressed.While the story was good it was too long and drawn out. I got bored about 1/2 of the way because it seemed that much of the action was repeated and I found the ""mind conversations"" dull and unrealistic. I had to make myself finish the book.",1
this movie was not too bad for an old b rated caveman movie if you liked caveman or quest for fire you may like this movie,1
"If I had not bought the paperback of this novel, I may not have finished it but since I paid hardearned money for it, I had to read it. The title tells it all. Why the father did not do more to verify what had happened to his child and her mother after he returned from WWII is hard to believe. I'm getting tired of shallow and predictable books. Any suggestions, anyone?",1
"It didn't cost much and it shows. The games aren't fun at all, but that is to be expected, however even the meant for children gameboy headphones had issues with the foam ear pads. They ripped very very easily which is concerning as a playful child could rip it and swallow pieces with relative ease. I already ordered replacement ear pads.Aside that, no complaints!",1
"The book tends to be repetitive but, it is well written by a very amusing writer about a very serious subject. This book sets out very well the threats that muslims represent to all others in the world, including themselves. It is full of an interesting record of atrocities perpetrated by muslim fundamentalists throughout the world which are very frightening. It is a must read for everyone.",1
I thought this book was very good. It willl help you to see how important love is and how important it is to love others.,1
"If you'd like to enlighten yourself with adventures and discoveries about how to live successfully; read this book. It offers more than just motivation, its discreet knowledge from a very successful man.Earl nightingale has an astounding mind and with it he has created some of the best literature and audio books I have ever obtained.This particular book gives insight and understanding to the idea of success for anyone. Living succesfully is not some unicorn idea that only a few can have, its rather the state of mind that makes successful individuals.The arguments Earl Nightingale proves wrong are some of todays most common held beliefs about wealth, determination, and spirit. They are unarguable the truth from a man whos known poverty as though it were his best friend.",1
"I found the Sanyo ""High Definition"" Camcorder to be the real deal.Recording in 720P is the only way to go. Playback is amazing and on my HDTV.I thought the small size my be a disadvantage but found the built-in stabilization to be adequate.The ability to use as a Digital Still camera is also advantageous.Also learned to operate this camcorder quite quickly with its easy to use menu.",1
"Everyone, regardless of dietary choices, should see this film. It follows three average Americans from different walks of life; a college student, a bachelor, and a single working mother, for six weeks of trying a vegan diet. It covers a lot of different aspects, health, social, and enviromental issues. I also like that it covers fish, which a lot of people don't think is bad, and a lot of so-called ""vegetarians"" continue to eat. I know when I first went vegetarian, I had to phase different items out of my diet, I just couldn't completely switch overnight, and fish was the last thing I gave up.I also like the message at the end that even if you don't continue eating a completely vegan diet that you can still do something rather then nothing.",1
"Full of great jokes and all the characters are memorable and outstanding. It's my favorite of the series, possibly favorite of any comedy series. And after all the jokes and sarcasm, there is this amazing scene at the very end that gives me goosebumps because it's so beautiful and really makes you feel the tragedy of war and the loss of lives. A series to watch again and again.",1
Accurate to history. Great depiction. Although did not detail the 95 theses and why he took out 7 books from old testament that does not support his doctrine. Books that exist and Christ refers to during his days. This purchase was actually my third one as one was a gift to a friend and the first my brother wished he had one...,1
"I have read lots of job search strategy books and this is simply one of the best I have come across. Very focused, practical, real-world suggestions, along with an informed Christian perspective on the difficulties facing the job seeker. An easy and substantive read. This valuable book is severely underpriced for all the insider knowledge the author conveys.",1
"Is this movie flawed? Oh yes. But this has more character and feels like more, genuine Trek than anything Berman and his bunch have put out in years. It really is a startling night and day difference to go back and watch some of these older Trek films and really just see how far Star Trek has declined since in quality. Very sad. Star Trek IV is even the more outstanding example of a night and day contrast. What happened to that? What happened to Star Trek? Why was it allowed to go down so low in the past...almost decade or so?These Special Edition DVD's are must owns for Trekkers, especially the classic films.You'll enjoy this one for nostalgia and completist's sake, if nothing else.",1
"This product is fantastic. I have never used foam glove conditioner before and it worked great. In my opinion, it's better than the oil based conditioners.",1
"""Hot Ice"" is a vintage Nora Roberts (cc 1987) but it is still a great romantic suspense novel. The rich heroine is ""kidnapped"" by the jewel thief and off they go on a treasure hunt. To add spice to the plot, on their heels is the evil Dimitri. I really enjoyed this novel.",1
"Dream is a very good group. This is me is a great song. The CD also includes a remix. Also enhanced with the video. They were gonna come out with a new album and the got a new member named Kasey. Melissa expressed her desire to leave the group, in order to appear in the Nick Cannon movie ""Love don't cost a thing"", and to work on a solo record. But the group split up when they released their new single ""Crazy"" which is aparently not available on amazon.com or anywhere. But anyway, This is me is a great song. It's out of stock. But mak sure you buy it used or new.",1
"The book is in worse conditions than it was advertised. Thank goodness it was the right price, becouse otherwise i'd send it back. its really worn out.",1
"This book was a wonderful book that kept my attention the whole time. Being that I took AP Biology this year, I connected alot of Biology terms in the book. I thought the story line was good, and it really showed a mother who cared for her son, maybe a little too much. The only thing i would change about this book would be the ending. I would have given the book a 4, but the ending kinda made me upset. To be frank, I hated the ending, but the whole book was really good and I would recomend it to anyone who reads. Cai Emmons is a great writter and I hope to read more of her books. She shows a lot of potential for becoming the next big writter. I hope, personally, she writes a book that follows this one up, becuase it kinda leaves you hanging at the end. All in all, i loved it!",1
"This book is excellent! Do I really mean it, given the insightful critiques on this page with low ratings for the book?Yes, I do; and I give it 5 stars to balance out the reviews. Every dish I've made so far has been absolutely delicious--fromthe plainer whole chicken and whole turkey recipes to fancier ones like Chicken Tagine with Green Olives and Preserved Lemon andMeditteranean Fish Stew. I can't wait to try out more recipes, my only regret being that the book is a small compendum rather than a large one with lots of recipes. What you eat, however, will be good!So add this to your collection and enjoy it.",1

"Hugh MacInnes was a first-rate automotive engineer and car guy who had ""been there, done that"" with turbochargers and turbo projects, and this book is packed with good stuff about all kinds of turbochargers and turbo engines. There is even interesting stuff in here about turbo aircraft, two-strokes, and much more. There is also some nice turbo history, and it is interesting to see the return in modern times of older ideas--like water-cooled turbos and ball-bearings. Anyone who is really interested in automotive technology will enjoy this book. Keep in mind, it was last updated a long time ago (late 80's?), so there is too much about carburetors and too little about elecronic fuel injection and engine managemant. But for real gearheads that won't matter: Have we lost all interest in steam locomotives because there are now diesels? I think not.",1
"This product is great for feeding you baby fresh fruit or bread before they are ready to eat completely on there own. Important in this produce is the 16 replacement bags. I purchased a similar produce from a different company that had the bag attached to the feeder. Attached bags are more difficult to clean/wash. The Sassy feeder bags completely detach and can be rinsed and washed well. (Takes a long time to get banana cleaned!) So for its use, this is a 5-star product. I did not give it 5 stars however, because of the usage part. It is difficult to open and close and cumbersome to handle a baby on your hip and the feeder at the same time. Cleaning can be difficult as part of the feeder has a groove (I used a knife to scrape out the groove out, but it didn't feel very sanitary). Finally, it is a short-term use product and not something that would typically be passed onto another user, so it becomes another piece of plastic in the landfill only after a very short time.",1
"I'm a more recent Soundgarden fan, but also a fan of Zeppelin, good vocals, good songwriting, and interesting guitar work. This album does not rock in a Soundgarden sense, and is more laid back.Still, the songwriting, guitar and especially Chris' talented pipes really make this an excellent album apart from his former band. He really is one of the best singers in rock, ever, and that fact really stands out solidly here.",1

"Brandy's other albums have been good, but her new song ""You Don't Know Me"", the remix, is real hot right now",1
This one pound bread machine is easy to use and turns out perfect bread and cakes every time. The one pound size is perfect for us (two people) but could easily satisfy a family of four or six. Watching the VHS tape before you start is highly recommended. My only recommendation: produce a DVD since a lot of folks no longer have a VHS player.,1
"Brian McKnight is a great singer and songwriter. I actually think this is a decent album, but not the best. There isn't anything really new or innovative, and I think that some of the songs are hits while other are ""non-hits"". I personally love his voice and even if some of the songs he is singing aren't up to par he still ""tears it up"" and that never changes about Brian Knight and it shows you how great a singer he truly is. My favorites are ""Back Seat (Gettin' Down)"" and ""Where Do We Go From Here"". Brian McKnight also gets my nod because he not only sings, but he plays piano and writes his own material and that is very admirable. 3 1/2 stars for Brian McKnight - ""U Turn"".",1
(review of the hard cover edition copywright 2005)...It just seems to follow her everywhere she goes. Kayla tries to live a upholding life but gets screwed along the way. First her fiance and her sister. Then her baby's daddy and of course there is some drama from individuals who just have to be contact with these people. They all have it in for Kayla. Poor Kayla can't even walk in her own house without experiencing drama. Just a drama queen in her own right. Can't wait to read no more drama.,1
"This book of ""Washington and his Comrades in Arms"" shows how he helped shape the U.S. and what accompishments he made for us. He was recruited by the Continental Congress for command of the army. He fought many difficult battles to to determine the outcome of the war. Many opposing forces stood in his way, for example, General Cornwallis and his gigantic battlaion. The knowledge and strength of Washington helped him defeat lots of obstacles and further him and his army to more victories. His strong leadership helped him win one of the most significant battles in history, the battle at Yorktown. Coming back to Philadelphia, many citizens cheered Washington winning all he could. This book is a great way to learn much about the life of Washington in the army.",1
"Savannah's Bonaventure Cemetery is a beautiful and haunting place to visit, and the book captures much of that beauty in plentiful photographs. But if you are looking for a history of Bonaventure, this volume is a light weight. Most of the facts are there, but their arrangement is haphazard, with little logical sequence. I was looking for some background informaiton on the original colonial plantation and the family that owned it, but found mostly information on various tombs, markers and headstones.",1
"I was hooked from from the first digit change on my DVD player! The plot is very well executed and slick. The actors are well known and not known which helps as you sit and think....""I know that guy, from somewhere!"" If you have a Dolby Digital amp, crank it up and listen to a cracking sound track which mixes with the action so well (as well as the golfing scene!) If you wish to know the true life of London's east end, watch this. Us English don't all drink tea and watch our football team struggle!",1
"Chekhov simply astonishes. ""The Lady with the Little Dog,"" one of his most famous stories, is rendered splendidly by Pevar and Volokhonsky. I don't know of any other writer who captures the confusion, fear and excitement of romantic love as well as Chekhov does here. The last line is perfect.",1

i love the bag. it feels like soft leather(maybe it is? idk). it's big enough w/o being bulky. & it looks good. the only thing i would change is that it would b nice 2 have a pocket 4 the cell phone. there is one inner pocket that can fit a few smaller things & then the main part of the purse is nice & deep.,1
"Celine is the best singer that there is PERIOD! I used to think that Mariah Carey what the best singer...but Celine has her beat!

"Burlap to Cashmere is a very talented and original band as far as musicality is concerned. They have very impressive guitar solos (almost a classical Spanish style) in many of their songs, and their fine natural abilities in rhythm allow them to create *solid* music in difficult time signatures (namely 5/4).""Treasures in Heaven"", and occasionally ""Basic Instructions"", are commonly played on the radio stations. Add the title song, ""Is There Anybody Out There"", and you already have three songs that are so good that you already feel like you got your money's worth.I refrained from giving it a fifth star only because their lyrics are not necessarily theologically deep or worship-inspiring... but this is my personal opinion. Definitely exciting and great for listening!One last helpful hint: don't forget that you can look to find out what music other people have bought. If you like the other music, you'll probably like this music.",1

The book's practical and easy to understand instructions makes it an excellent guide to beginners and experience witches alike.Putting the ""evil"" spells aside, this work is as good, if not better, than Anna Riva's other book, SPELLCRAFT, HEXCRAFT and WITCHCRAFT...It's a must buy!",1

I have reviewed this previously and have been using it for over a year( I am a woman with thinning hair since menopause). This stuff does actually disguise thinning areas on my scalp and as a bonus it also covers my gray roots. I use a combination of dark brown and medium brown to get a more natural effect. It lasts until I shampoo again.The only con is that it does get all over the bathroom counters but it's easily wiped up with a damp sponge.,1
Provides people new to breeding a good overall view of the process. It is easy to read and a good reference. This is not the highly technical manual that would turn away the amatuer. At the same time it lacks depth to be a truly serious resource.,1
I used 2 of these T-tracks to make a vertical sliding extension on the ends of a work table in my wood shop. I clamp a 2 x 4 to the top of the slides equal to the height of my table saw. Now I can cut an 8 foot sheet of plywood by myself without having the plywood fall on the floor. Quick and easy to adjust. Free plans for the roll around shop table can be found on the Woodsmith web site.,1
Made in China. Doesn't keep my coffee warm enough. If I have a traditional small coffee mug that is half full it will keep pretty hot but if it's 3/4 full or a larger coffee mug then the coffee gets gets cold or at least not at the 125-130F degree I like. I'm returning and looking for more wattage. 17 watts isn't enough for me.,0
"Hey everyone, its your band buddy vamp again. I don't recommend this product because the spitballs get stuck in the trumpet/brass instrument. I don't know if anyone has ever taken a trumpet completely apart to get one of these out, well other than me of course, but it is darn near impossible to ""snake"" these out once they are stuck. I had to run the valves under the bath tap (at full pressure) to get the darn ball unstuck. When the spitball gets wet, it expands...yea. So just use a snake rag and call it a day.",0
"There is nothing about this puzzle that is pleasing. I'm going to try and return it, even though I know it is going to be a hassle to do. The numbers felt like they were going to fall out of the puzzle and yet, when you tried to manipulate the metal blocks they would hang up on each other. In addition the size of the puzzle was an utter disappointment and pictures showing on the web are deceiving. I have a plastic puzzle that came out of a cracker-jack box that is bigger and better working than this piece of garbage.",0
"I bought this set as I wanted a cheap wooden set - nothing fancy..The pieces on this set are so light that if you just slightly brush a piece when trying to move another piece, that and five other pieces will fall over - the pieces are simply too light - it is impractical.Suggest you buy a plastic set or invest a little more in a decent wood one.",0

"This book is a terrible bastardization of metaphysical principals and is couched in terms that are senseless. (5 senses vs. multi-sensory. Isn't five multi?) Not only are the labels Zukav attaches to profound phenomena bizarre, single paragraphs display unfollowable leaps of logic. Most of his ideas have realistic foundations in metaphysical thought shared by many religions, but here they are twisted into strange new age hooha. Skip this book.

"I was all excited to get some Hawkins after hearing his amazing voice (and seeing his cameo in Mystery Train). This album looked like a good best-of, but boy is it a stinker. The all-synthesized backing is ear-achingly cheesy and this definitely doesn't sound like Jay at his best. Minus a million points because the only rendition of ""I Put a Spell on You"" is a really stupid ""dance version"" with an extremely dated rap shoved into it.",0

"I didn't really like this movie that much. The movie is about guys looking at women, taking pictures of them, and peeping through holes watching them take showers. The women look nice in bikinis, and I guess that is suppose to be the premise of movie, the title says so, women in bikinis galore. I don't really remember the movie that much, I guess that's how forgetful it was. It ends with a bikini contest that the cops try to stop, and how it gets resolved seems stupid, and in the end a female cop gets to try on a bikini as if to say the contest wasn't all that corrupt or illegal. Plus, none of the women are really that pretty, though they have nice bodies.",0
"I was all about this show. I was head over heals in love with it. That is up until the last 4 episodes! Where they proceeded to cheat me and every other viewer out of a good ending to the season. It's like the writers woke up one day and just decided they had better stuff to do. Everything leading up to the last 4 episodes is simply amazing. But after putting in the time for 20 episodes, I expected the same creativity and ""wow-ness"" in the ending. It was a let down.I won't be watching Heroes next season!",0
"Jonathan Lear is clearly a very clever man, but this is one of those terribly annoying books where intelligence has just gone astray. Lear is writing - as with so many professors - with more than one eye on his colleagues. Hence his prose is extremely leaden, slow, burdened by trivial references - academic in the worst sense. And this is no minor quibble because Lear is dealing with the most important questions of life, and yet doing so in the language of a first year PhD student. Let's hope that in his next book Lear will find the courage to tell us what he really thinks, rather than restort once more to ultimately banal readings of Plato and Freud.",0
I bought this game after looking at under the PS2 section and purchased it. After it arrived i found out that it's for the PC and it's a DVD. If you zoom in on the picture it even say's this. After this little dissapointment i went ahead and tried to install it on my computer. My DVD drive didn't even recognize the disk. This particaular version of the game as far as i can tell really sucks and if i were you i would avoid it with every part of your being. The other titles on the other hand are great. But please do not even attempt to click the purchase button on this titel. Especially if you don't have a computer.,0

"Struggling with drawing the human figure and looking for easy answers I was suckered into buying this book by the positive reviews. It's one of the weakest drawing instructionals I've ever seen. It's style is heroic comic book. That's not bad in itself, as you can learn a lot of proportion and foreshortening from good line art. The problem, besides poor drawing, is the lessons(?) go something like this: draw a circle, now divide that into thirds and ""poof"", here's the finished drawing! No real instruction, no real system. I found this book useless and even embarrassing to have on the bookshelf. There is no easy answer to drawing the human figure except drawing the human figure and learning from your mistakes. Don't bother with this book, there are better instructions out there.",0

"First off, there is nothing startling about this waste of paper and ink. In fact, the whole concept of angels abandoning their heavenly abodes for the sake of earthly women is a theme that has been explored by bigger (and better) writers of both fiction and nonfiction. The constant comparing of the Book of Enoch to the books of the Bible grows dull very quickly, and the author's own commentary doesn't really add much, either. If you're truly interested in the Nephilim, then I suggest reading ""The Gods of Eden"" or ""Genesis Revisited"".",0

"I'm new to telecom and I needed a comprehensive but easy to read book. This wasn't a good choice.The book does have a good glossary. However, after the first few pages the authors suddenly start tossing around acronyms as if everyone innately understands them.But worse by far is that paragraphs are out of sequence. You have to figure out for yourself that the paragraph you are reading is related to three paragraphs back but not the immediately preceding paragraphs. I found this very distracting and unpleasant and I really wished the authors had invested in editing services. You can piece together the logic but you have to be a pretty brave soul to take on a new, technical subject, a rather dry one at that, with a book that isn't strong on logical editorial flow.I wouldn't recommend this book except perhaps to someone already familiar enough with the material that the literary weaknesses don't hinder study.",0
"John Lee is the guy who reads the book for the audiobook version. Up to now I have only heard Roy Dotrice, so it's entirely possible I just got used to Mr. Dotrice, but John Lee grates on my ear like crazy - I could not listen to him for even one chapter. All the stresses sounded wrong and the voices were completely different. It just lost something. Again, I don't know if it's just the shift from what I'm used to, but I would advise going with Mr. Dotrice as opposed to Mr. Lee.",0

"The description given by this seller was not accurate. He forgot to mention the dead pixcels and the brownout right in the middle of the monitor. I will never by from this seller. I had bought used monitors and they were right on the money with the description, so no surprise. I was very mad when I plug this monitor and discover all the flaws not listed. Any other person would it send this back. I didn't because I hate to do returns. What the heck I will eat this one because is the first and last from this seller.",0
"The sound quality is so bad you feel like you're listening to something out of a tin can. The picture is great, but the sound is hard to overcome. The audio is digital dolby - not stereo. We are going to return it and pay the 15% restocking fee for something with better sound quality.",0
"Had I been paying closer attention, I would have noticed that the amazon video on demand version of this excellent performance was 60 minutes, as opposed to the 130 minute listed running time of the DVD. Which means that I'm missing a lot. Don't make my mistake - get the DVD.",0
"I am female and I travel a long distance to work everyday andI thought it would be great to use whenever I am stuck intraffic. Well, I tried it yesterday and I was notable to get it unfolded enough and I was never able toget any urine in the bag. Needless to say I was smartenough to put plastic on my car seat, because I definitelywet my pants. As confused as I was the first time, I hadto go again while still stuck in traffic, so I tried anotherbag and once again I got wet all over. I guess it requirespractice, but I am not a fan at this time.",0
I bought this timer at home depot and would not recommend it to anyone. I followed instructions and it didn't even work. Don't waste your time or money!,0
"I did not have time to enjoy this purchase. We filled it with birdseed and not 2 minutes after hanging it, it fell and broke. I had securely hung it with the wire that was attached. The wire did stay, however the rest of it feel. I would not purchase this product again. So sad because it's a pretty feeder.",0
"I have always been a fan of REM, and this CD had a track on it that was particularly meaningful for me, as I first heard it one desperate day when I was seriously contemplating suicide. The track was ""Everybody Hurts""....and for me at that time, it said it all.The other tracks are up to the usual high standard of muscianship of this group.....in a word, AWESOME!!",0
"This is not a very good textbook and should not be considered if you desire to learn chemistry. The text is not understandable even though I have a masters in chemistry from CalTech.The organization is not well structured and it's hard to believe that people actually like this book. The writers of this book try to ""cram"" as much information as possible in each chapter which is NOT necessary. It could be sucessfuly done if they spread out the information and concepts.HOWEVER, he book problems are excellent. I'll give them that.",0
"A few weeks ago I bought these for a total of $7 with s&h. Today they are $10 with s&h! They bend sooooo easy, they shouldn't be so pricey.",0
"I want to say that I only managed to get to page 78 in this book and even that was difficult. The write-ups on this book make it sound like it's about students when they didn't even enter the picture until page 54 and only in a perfunctory interaction (and that was the only interaction through page 78). What this book really seems to be about is a boring, solitary bachelor who dwells far too much on his own thoughts (annoying attempts at deep thinking and quasi-intellectualism that end up being nothing but annoying). I could not force myself to finish this book. I figure if it had anything to say, it should have started saying it before a quarter through the book. This was just tedious. I read hordes of books, particularly for young adults (as an English teacher) and I would never recommend this.",0
"Granted, this grater is advertised as a grater for hard cheese, nuts, and chocolate, but it didn't specify only cold chocolate! Trying to grate room temperature chocolate in this utensil only results in globs that have to be pushed through.And, wouldn't one think most nuts are hard? Not so. Walnuts are smashed rather than grated as are Macadamia nuts,After the fiascos with chocolate and nuts we didn't even try for the cheese!",0
"I looked closely at the picture and description. I saw 6 contacts, so I ordered. when the product arrived, there were 4 contacts. I returned the product.",0
"The book in itself, that is, when there was interesting facts about serial killers and how the FBI solves crimes, is actually very good and interesting. The parts of this book I truged through was Mr. Douglas and his ego tripping about dating and joking around though school etc. Certainely could have lived without that. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to finish this book as it did not hold my interest. I probably will not invest in another one of his books.",0
"This looked like cheap plastic--very yellow. Not the luster of marble, but a shiny cheap material.This didn't have the high end look I desired, so returned it ASAP.",0
"This film was so dull I scanned a good deal of it on fast forward. I think the characters only seemed scared because the actors knew what this movie would do to their careers.The only reason it got 2 stars is because I have seen a few FIMBY's (Filmed In My Back Yard) & Italian films that were worse. It wasn't bad in that regard as that was the intentional style and was not done poorly, but not much happened and there wasn't an actual plot. The whole story could have been a 1/2 hr show on TV and would have been better.I love horror movies, but this wasn't scary or intriguing in any way.",0
"after only one week use at home, the sole was completely broken. the worst quality slipper i have ever seen!",0
"Rest assured I'm not going to use any of the following words in my review: dumb, Hilton, sucks, Paris.Unbelievable tripe. Not even of the so-bad-it's-good variety. Poorly acted, and featuring a plethora of plot unusualness and a potato headed strumpet. The latter of course will sell a few copies of the dvd, but that aside there is little to recommend here.",0
"This book is one of the most depressing novels I have ever read. Yes, it is very well written. Oates is a masterful story teller. But the main characters, the Mulvaneys, (with the exception of Marianne) are the most self-absorbed, shallow, deluded and cruel family members you could ever meet. Their actions are inexplicable and unforgivable. Possibly most annoying, the epilogue is so different from the rest of the book and so out of character for this family that it has the tacked-on feel of a bad Hollywood ending. It would have been much more realistic if the book had ended with the episode before the epilogue. If you need to be convinced that life is a dark lonely place and that you can't depend on anyone, including your closet friends and family, this book is for you. If you need a reason to commit suicide, this book could be it. Otherwise, steer clear of the Mulvaneys.",0
"My friend who usually has good taste, recommeded this CD to me, and I really had no idea what it was going to be like except mellow. I like some mellow, U2 is okay. I put in this CD and I was so BORED. Sorry. Every song sounded the same and didn't stir any emotion in me. I gave the cd to a co-worker, big mistake because apparently she loves it and plays it over and over again, which adds to my hatred of this wretched cd.. Go buy American Life,,, much better.. or some Johnny Cash...",0
"I bought these to replace a very long lived pair of leather chaps.With less than 1 year on the pants, the left leg zipper started to fail. With 18 months on them, both zippers regularly pull apart. The problem is, the leg zippers are the fine toothed ""waterproof"" zippers, instead of heavy duty zippers. Those zippers are fine for short runs, but for 26""+ long leg zippers, they just can't stand up to regular usage. My Tourmaster jacket has a heavy duty primary zipper, and it works wonderfully. I just don't know why Tourmaster decided to go with these small-tooth zippers for the legs.To add insult to injury, the crotch of the pants was only waterproof for the first month or so. After that, any water that pooled between the seat and my legs quickly left me with wet shorts underneath.I stayed about as dry in my chaps, and the zippers on those held up for over 8 years.",0
"Although ""Run, Lola, Run"" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The ""driving music beat"" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (""Lost and Delirious"", ""The Smokers"", ""Black and White"" and ""Armageddon""). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...""Run Away, Run""",0
"In this collection, Raffi seems to need a few cups of coffee. The songs are slow and humorless and the arrangements very basic (boring.) However, the best songs in this collection can be found in much more lively versions on the Raffi in Concert album, which is a lot of fun. The singable songs collection is very good too, as is the Christmas album.",0
"Excellent film - bad DVD. ""This Special Edition"" features a print which is sub-standard, so better beware. It's fun to have the British version of the movie on this DVD - nonetheless a little bit more care concerning picture quality would have been nice for 50th birthday presentation of this landmark movie.",0
The author should study her history and get the facts!This book was a joke. I was rather furious and more than disappointed. Marie Antoinette's name was drug through the mud over 200 years ago based on hearsay and false accusations.Isn't it time she is given the credit due her by now?Read your facts author!,0
"The sound was pretty good, if not a bit too much bass..but the lack of a volume control knob turned out to be a bigger hassle than I even imagined it would be. I'm very proactive with my sounds as my MP3's are all over the place volume wise. To not be able to tell whether my actions would yield a louder/lower sound was the deal breaker. Not only that but you have to contort your fingers/wrist to utilize those silly pads..spent half my time trying to gauge if my actions were providing the desired results..and forget about trying to accomplish this with the lights low..bottom line, I sent them packing and bought the Klipsch Pro Media's instead. So far, very happy....",0
"The Walter Matthau version of ""Little Miss Marker"" tries very hard to capture the authentic 1930s Damon Runyon flavor. The art direction is superb, the Henry Mancini score is wonderful, and Matthau is fine as always, but the film promises more than it delivers. The original Runyon story tells of a hard-hearted bookie who reluctantly accepts a little girl as security for a wager, and gradually thaws out as he cares for the child as his own. The story (faithfully told in the 1934 Adolphe Menjou-Shirley Temple film version) strikes all the right notes as the plot progresses, but the 1980 script rambles aimlessly and often overlooks key plot points, with many missed opportunities for the Runyon warmth and humor. Still watchable thanks to Matthau and villain Tony Curtis, but what should have been a sure winner finishes out of the money.",0

"Female yuppie from South Beach falls for life in small-town Minnesota. The storyline is anything but new and the outcome predictable, but that is what I expect from something labeled ""romantic comedy"". Unfortunately, unlike Sandra Bullock or Diane Keaton, Renee Zellweger cannot pull off the role of corporate executive; there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Harry Connick; and unless you consider stereotypes and cliches funny, there is not much to laugh about.It wasn't a bad movie for the day after Christmas but overall unconvincing and too annoying to be entertaining.",0
"This movie is the 21st centuries version of a ""B"" rated movie. It is entirely predictable and not very thrilling for being a mystery thriller movie. The acting, well, I hope these actors don't quit their real jobs. You guess the ending before it's over. I would certainly NOT waste $ to purchase this movie.",0
"My review is about the DVD itself not the movie. I loved the movie Bugsy Malone when I was a child so I was thrilled to see it again in DVD. Well to my surprise the DVD took 4 weeks to get here. Then when it was here it wouldn't play because it's in ""Blue Ray"" formmat. I don't have a blue Ray player and it doesn't mention about it's being only in Blue Ray formant on the order page. So I waited 4 weeks and can't play the DVD when I finally got it. Not to mention paying the postage to return it for a refund.",0
"I bought this book after reading tons of positive reviews praising it. It was meant for a preview to my Linear Algebra and Applications class and as an alternative reference. I read through about half of the book before the semester began, but we pretty much learned everything I read from this within two weeks. I gave up on it and it was just sitting there until I decided to further clarify to myself the concept of kernel and image, and all the proof questions associated with them. And guess what, this book doesn't even address these concepts. Now I have no reason to even open this book because real college level courses go well beyond this depth and relying on the information in here for tests is just an academic suicide...",0
"I've read several books by Perri O'Shaughnessy and found them to be reasonable entertaining but Keeper of the Keys was a very poor effort. I don't just fault the authors, however. Where was the editor or publisher? Didn't anyone read this book before it was printed? I am not at all surprised by the negative comments regarding this book. What does amaze me, however, are the few individuals who thought it was good.",0
"Wow! While the author's honesty and pure heart-wrenching feelings were wonderfully portrayed, the book could have been shortened by 150 pages. Hearing the same information 2 or 3 times in the same paragraph was irritating to the point of putting the book down many times. It took me over a week to read 'cause I just couldn't deal with the inconsistencies of the ""flashbacks"" and the constant repetitiveness.",0
I have worn Thorlo Running Rolltop Socks for at least 20 years with no problem. I am extremely disappointed in this last purchase in that the elastic at the top is very tight. The opening itself is small and evidently made for a little girl's foot.,0

"Crenshaw was most certainly there in the ER during the futile attempt to save JFK, but he has said some things that he must have made up.For example, he claims to have seen a small ""entrance"" wound in JFK's throat. But he also claims to have gone into the ER with Dr. McClelland, and McClelland entered the ER *after* the throat wound had been obliterated by the tracheotomy.His claim to have gotten a call from LBJ during the attempt to save Oswald just doesn't work. LBJ was headed out to the ceremonies during which JFK's body was moved to the Capitol.Worst of all, in this book he claims that LBJ wanted a confession from Oswald. But in an earlier version of his story, LBJ demanded that Oswald be killed! It seems that people failed to believe this, and it was changed![...]",0
"This CD is a step down from the Mechanical Animals CD. If you are a Marilyn Manson fan, then stop and read this. This CD is nothing like AntiChrist Superstar or Holywood. With Twiggy gone, so has the hard sound that made Manson famous. All songs have a good hard beat somewhere in the song, but then change to a techno sounding beat and an annoying sounding chorus. Not very hard sounding. Manson has changed his sound so much that it is hard to even realize that this is from the individual who once produced Antichrist Superstar.",0
"This game is cute, silly, and perfect for toddlers. The bad news is that the butterflies only blow out if the batteries are brand new. After two or three rounds, the fan slows and no longer blows out the butterflies well, sending out maybe one or two every couple of minutes. When the batteries are first put in, it's a lot of fun. Half an hour later, it's no fun at all. I am returning this game. There are plenty of other cute. silly toddler games out there which do not require fresh batteries every day, such as Crocodile Dentist.",0
"I heard all these excellent reviews of Le Guinn's ""Earthsea"" books. I read it and thought, ""Is this the same book that all these people have read?"" It was stupid. I mean, it was better than anything Terry Goodkind and Terry Brooks could ever hope to write, but that's not sayig much. Then I re-read it to catch this big deep underlying theme. There wasn't any. Or, at least, not any worth reading. If your a fan of Tolkien, Lewis, Jordan, or Feist, don't waste your time on ""EathSea.""",0
"I bought this CD after hearing two of their songs on the radio. I was disappointed. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing, but the guitars and drums drown her out. Overall, this is a very mediocre CD. The only two songs that I like are ""My Immortal"" due to the theme of lost love and melancholy and ""Hello"" because I love the piano that's interlaced throughout the song. I don't know what lead singer Amy Lee sees in the rest of her band, but she'd be better off solo. I gave this CD two stars for the two songs I like.",0
"Real assertiveness should mean expressing yourself clearly and directly, standing up for yourself when it's appropriate, while having respect for the rights of others. The techniques in THIS book, however, are manipulative, obnoxious and ridiculous. I would not want to act like this, or for other people to act this way toward me.",0
"The title of this book is a little pretentious, perhaps the author thinks very highly of herself and her writing ability.I wonder what Coach Wooden thought of people with inflated egos, the kind which many ball players and authors have today. I think he would find them disgusting and sad, and view those people as lacking integrity and humility, but that is just my opinion.",0
These are so nice looking and functional...however the smell is discusting and i cant take it anymore...these are going back.,0
"It is obvious people are rating this movie based on the calibre of actors in it.That is why I watched it in the first place, especially because of Tommy Lee.Unfortunately it was a waste of time and I slept off on it.It is just another predictable space movie, nothing more.Shows a loss of ideas and lack of creativity.Nothing exceptional.It is deja vu.Why did they give it that title anyway?",0
"If you look at the other books the author has written, you'll see that he just spits out these celebrity biographies as quickly as he can to make a buck, without taking the time to do any new research. Like the other reviewers said, this book is a complete waste of time and is so carelessly written, with many errors in songtitles and dates, etc. Mark Bego should be ashamed of himself for producing such a poorly written book.",0
"I was very disappointed with the first of two stories in this book. I felt this dialog to be cheesy and did not have interest in reading the second story. Never before have I seen Coulter publish such a disappointing read. While I cannot recommend this book, I do recommend others she has written that were so much better, on a different level entirely.",0
"The person or persons resposible for writting this film should be punished. If your going to make a serious a movie, then make a serious movie, if your going to make a comedy, make a comedy, don't mix them. You can do that with some films, but not the one because it does not cleary draw the line at where the seriousness begins and the comedy ends. What makes me even more mad is that I saw a critic on T.V. who said that it was THIS generations STAR WARS, this scum should never even look the way of STAR WARS. The special effects are the only thing that sold this poor excuse for a science fiction film, and to tell you the truth they weren't anything that SPECIAL. END",0

"When I purchased this item in August, it was allowed to be put on up to 5 devices. When I attempted to put it on my 4th device, an actual kindle, I was told that now it's only active on three devices. Fine, I deauthorized my laptop and put it on the actual kindle. I'm now trying to take it off my iPod touch, device three, to put it on my phone and guess what, now they are telling me that the license changed again to two devices. Because this doesn't work for me, I can buy it elsewhere. What's worse is I paid $36 for the book that has gone to $23. Now I'm given the access as if I paid $23 for a book that I actually paid $36 for the access. I spend over a thousand dollars annually for my college books from this company. I have learned to never do that again. What a waste. More their loss than mine. I lost $36, They lost several hundred (Spring semester 2012).",0
Very poor development of the product. They are not cheap for the lack of quality instructions and product support. I've had to call them twice in a row as the tech support people couldn't figure it out either.Over priced item and lousy performance.,0
"Since I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark, and since ""Weep No More, My Lady"" was one of my favorite books, I really looked forward to viewing this tape. The entire movie is a mess. The storyline has been drastically changed, the location of the main action moved to another country (hence the French production, who unfortunately didn't have a clue about how to make this type of movie)and most distressing of all is the total lack of suspense, even to the point of not only changing the villain, but revealing the identity well before the end of the movie. Why Mary Higgins Clark's books have not been given the production values of the film adaptations of other piopular authors, such as John Grisham, remains the biggest mystery of all to me. Based on this terrible movie, I think it is time for Mary Higgins Clark to think twice before signing any agreements for movie adaptations, unless she can negotiate a contract which protects the integrity of her work.",0

"Having read the book and met with the author's, I found the book slim on facts and overall lacking merit in self help. Whereas, I am sure they were part of a group that should be investigated, the authors are as extreme. Self help and improvement books take a solid and inner tone of problem recognition and ways moving from dark problem places to everyday life. Both the authors and the book think they have pin pointed a problem and have moved into the mainstream. In point of fact, both the book and authors are still in a very dark place and are seeking revenge more then anything else.",0
"Really disappointing. This was so badly written and tedious that I just gave up after about the first quarter of the book. Rife with typos, too!",0
"As another reviewer indicated, this is one of Gull records/ Transluxe/ Koch records attempts to cash in on the Judas Priest name. This album, Genocide and The best of Judas Priest are substandard, unauthorized reissues of the first two Priest records, Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny.The sound quality sucks and there is no new material on these that you won't find on the actual albums. Be careful what you buy!! If it says Gull records, Transluxe, Koch records or Koch international on it you are getting ripped off. Support Judas Priest, the best heavy metal band of all time, and don't waste your money on this crap. Buy the real thing, Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny, which is still available through Cdnow/Amazon.Watch for the label!!!!!!!",0

"Disclaimer: I didn't finish this book. I COULDN'T finish this book. It was so preposterously self-involved, so ridiculously dreary, so bloated with period-speak and crammed with philosophy, historical name dropping, heavy-handed pseudo-feminism and scientific lecturing, that I made it about a hundred pages in and gave up. A hundred pages. If a book's not going to grab me by then, it's never going to get there.",0

"Violent, gruesome, nudity. Should be removed from the shelves. My 7 year old son told me he read one of these books that a friend in his second grade class brought in. I purchased a few books in the series and we reviewed one for content. I was horrified to see that it talked about murder, a person saves a bucket of human livers and has to move to another town because he has run out of victims. There were pictures of nude girls on a few of the pages. Although it says it is for Teen on the back cover- Young kids are reading these books. My nephews, who are teens, think these books are for young kids. Most teens are not interested in reading them. Which shows that these books although labeled for teens have a young child audience. I am bringing the books I purchased last night, back to the store this morning.",0
"For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la"" and ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy.",0
"I have been a fan of Journey for over 20 years. Steve Augeri is a very good singer. But if they wanted a trually great soulful voice with great range, they should have gone after HUGO. Who is 10 times the vocalist Steve Perry ever dreamed of being. Let's face it, the last great release was ESCAPE, from top to bottom that was one of the greatest albums ever. This is almost as bad as Raised on Radio... They should just break up for good and go about on solo careers again. Which by the way, Neal Schoon had some great solo releases. Stop putting out this garbage and salvage what is left of any credibility and hang JOURNEY up for good... They were once great, now they stink... The album sales are not that good, and they are not filling the arenas any more. Actually they are playing to half full small theatres... Trually very, very sad.....",0
Beowulf is the enbodyment of everthing I can't stand in a male. He is arrogant and vain. It is completely unnecesary to announce every person's linage every time a person is spoken of. YUCK!!!!!!

"This has to be the most disappointing book that I have ever read. Why? Because after waiting so long for this book to be published it was so badly written that I found myself actually angry at the author. He ignores his own rules, eliminates major characters with barely a sentence worth of explanation, and spends much of the book simply covering ground we've already covered in the previous book. Before this book I would have said Jordan was one of the greats in fantasy but now I am convinced that he simply doesn't know where he is going with his story.",0
"This unit has its quirks, as detailed in other reviews, but works fine once you figure out that the water tank needs to be pushed down, wait for the little orange light to turn off, etc. But it has one fatal flaw.The water for the espresso is not heated hot enough.Proper espresso should be brewed at 194'-203' F. This one pours blank shots (no coffee, just water through the machine) at maximum 160' which is far too cold for proper espresso brewing.After months of working with the confounded machine trying to pour a good, dark shot, I just went back to using our stovetop Moka pots, which are a little too hot (they brew at boiling, 212'F) but make appropriately dark espresso.That's basically all you need to know. It just doesn't brew at the right temperature. Save your money, get a Moka, or find a machine that you know brews at the right temperature.",0

Despite the hype, there's nothing more in this book than a 10 year-old child could write in a few minutes, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the books in this series (all by the same author) are degrading to the dignity of animals. What a shame.",0
"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What ever happend to this being ""The scariest movie of the summer""? All I have to say is that I was utterly disappointed, thank God that I rented it first.",0
"I recently purchased two of these phones for my office to replace two very disapointing GE models, as soon as I had them set up, I immediately bought a third for my home. It might seem to be a minor detail, but even the batteries were included. The hands free feature is excellent, programming is a snap and fairly customisable, the intercom is great, it's expandable up to eight extensions, great sound quality all around. I hope that panasonic will make a cordless model that is compatible with this system.",0
"I gave this item two star. I purchased these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He went to put the mats in his truck and they seemed too small and did not fit properly at all. The part of the tray that was supposed to reach the side of the running board (where the door closes...) did not even reach the door.So wondering if I got the correct part or not, we called WeatherTech directly. A very nice woman at WeatherTech said that the part number given to us through Amazon was for a Ford Explorer - not for an F350, his truck, like I had thought I ordered through Amazon's ""right fit"" easy guided, form check.Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I'm an amazon fan in most cases - but not this time! I'm sure it fits a Ford explorer though...",0
"I wanted this month's or maybe next month's magazine. Why would I want last month's? It's out of date now! Why would I have to pay for that? I feel ripped off.I love Glamour magazine. But, sending me last month's magazine isn't cool.",0

"This book could be good for Electrical Engineers or Physicists interested in the field, but I really would not recommend it to researchers with background in Computer Science. The notations and everything are makes reading and following naturally harder for us.",0
This item requires full assembly and attachment to a wall. It's very flimsy and could easily be toppled over without wall attachment. The shelf is a rod and small ledge and items easily slip through. It's not worth nore than $10! Buyer beware!!!,0
"Perhaps I've been spoiled with the French translation, but I find that the English translation (original and revised) can't hold a candle to the most recent French revision (2001).Not only does the French translation render the passages more literally, but it maintains the Latin Vulgate tradition in many places. Examples of the former include (and I translate from the French): ""In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was waste and void, darkness covered the abyss, and God's breath was hovering over the waters"" and ""the Word was made flesh and camped among us."" Examples of the latter include (and again I translate from the French): ""Rejoice, filled with grace, the Lord is with you"" and ""let him be anathema""I should note that the French translation also maintains traditional Hebrew, Greek, and Roman units of measurement and monetary nomenclature, which I prefer to the English translation's attempt to approximate.",0
"It was sort of interesting, maybe just because you can look at Alison Elliot during the movie. Christopher Walken is his usual psychotic self.",0
"This litter pan says it is a jumbo size, but it is far from it. The bottom is the same size of a traditional litter pan. The only jumbo to it, is that it is taller. I am not happy with it. I mean, it is great for a single cat, but not multiple ones. I wanted a litter pan that had alot of room for moving around, not just taller.",0
I expected the blanket to be a lot softer then it is. My new born still sleeps on it so I gave it at least 2 stars. I washed it and combed it out and by the time I was done the blanket looked like it was many years old not to mention it took over an hour to comb. Not worth the price. My sister has same type of blanket and it is much softer. I will try a different brand next time.,0

"This antenna did not work for me (in Fairfax county, Virginia). It picked up 6 analog channels and ZERO digital channels - I tried positioning it in different angles. I went to the local Best Buy and got a Terk TV5 antenna. It picked up about 18 analog channels and 12 digital channels immediately - no pointing required. I am sorry I did not spend the extra money in the first place, but you don't have to be.",0
"In my opinion, the hype is all this book has. I have spent my life reading most of the classics, along with best sellers, biographies, etc. I stopped counting when I got to 10,000 books read, about 13 years ago, so I consider myself to be a book connoisseur. This Catcher in the Rye is one book I wish I never read. Actually I didn't even bother to finish it, because it is such a waste of paper and time. If you want to read a great coming of age book, read A Separate Peace or A Prayer for Owen Meany. If you want to read about a real hero, read The Real George Washington.",0

"This film is a waste of time. It is macabre without being entertaining at all. It is just a bad movie. Based on the movie poster, you think you are going to see a sexy film, ala 9 1/2 Weeks, or Wild Orchid. From the description, you think it might be a little bit funny.Instead, this film features four senseless murders, an aimlessly wandering plot, boring conversation, and a brutal raping that is no picnic to watch. Where is the clever dialogue? Where is the entertainment value? And if no entertainment value is to be found, did I learn anything from watching this movie ? I learned that I should have gotten another video.Don't waste your money or your time. Get something else. If I could, I would give this film a 0 or a negative rating, rather than the ""1 star"" which is the only selection available.",0
"Buck-O-Nine is a pretty average ska band. They play a couple catchy songs, but unfortunatly they aren't very talented musicians, and this makes for songs that lack variety. Another problem is the vocalist, who sounds like a frog. Not a big bull frog, or a little one for that matter, but, you know, just one of those average green frogs you see in ponds. If you just heard their single on the radio, I can't blame you for thinking that these guys are the greatest. But believe me, If you take the time to delve a little deeper into the ska and punk scenes, you'll find that most real ska makes this band look pathetic.",0
"Perhaps being a bit ""old-fashioned"" I am not a big fan of Third Edition. While I will agree that the new Player's Handbook is beautiful and well presented as a book, I generally do not like the 3rd Edition game for several reasons. Mainly, I think that it makes characters a little too powerful. I can understand adding some power to a few classes to spruce them up, but allowing ability scores over 18? Adding a point to scores of your choice to the tune of 1 point per 4 levels? Perhaps the biggest thing is the less than smooth transition of existing characters into 3E and the fact that all of my old gaming supplements don't easily translate. As for the book, the biggest annoyance that i have is that the spells are listed alphabetically, not by class and level. Perhaps that is a pet peeve, who knows. Anyway, I am sure that the new game will appeal to many people but I for one will stick to my old favorite.",0
"This might be a really good book - but who can tell? I bought the Kindle edition and it's nearly impossible to read any of the lists, charts, etc. and the font size of said lists can't be altered. If you want this book... do yourself a favor and consider buying the actual book instead of the Kindle edition!",0
"Of Trash. Michael Eisner is a money crazy freak. Disney is not how it used to be, and this movie shows it. The classic musicals are no more. This movie is a take on of Treasure Island, so why couldn't they just make it treasure island? They have to make everything so ""Teen"", because it is not about the kids anymore, or even the teens, just the money.PS: Walt Disney would roll around in his grave if he see's his name on trash like this movie, and the disney channel stuff, and the expensive tickets to get into the park he made for ALL kids to enjoy.",0
"I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 1987, so I was looking forward to listening to this CD. I was in for a major disappointment.Most of Bon Jovi's music is upbeat and cool. But these songs have been done in a way than they are mourneful and depressed. Only one song on the whole CD was not ruined by the new style.Unless you are contemplating suicide, and want something else to listen to besides Kansas' ""Dust In The Wind"", avoid this CD like the plague, especially if you are a Bon Jovi fan.",0
"Tangerine is an ""interesting"" book that shows the troubles of a legally blind boy. Paul and family move to Tangerine, Florida. His brother, Eric, tortures him. It was a mystery how he became blind. His school gets sucked into a sinkhole and then goes to a new school. Read about his troubles and good times.I didn't like this book because the plot didn't catch me. The characters were sometimes hard to believe but sometimes interesting. If you were looking to read a diary I would rather read the Diary of Anne Frank than this book. This book is for people who read half diaries, half novels.",0
I ordered this for my mother in the USA but it would not play on her DVD. She is sending it to me to see if it will work on mine. So I don't know why.,0

Moreover than just the design being pitiful, I believe the tape itself to be of poorer quality now as well - I had two break off right near the 1"" line within three weeks time. I gave the new style an honest chance. NEVER AGAIN. I wish I could give less that 1 star.",0
"I was told this was about Irish Catholics in Boston and so I thought it would an ideal program to show the family on Sunday morning. WELL!!! I was very surprised to find a great deal of profanity and violence in a film billed as a Catholic film for children. Poor little Daphne was horrified by all the blood and has refused to come out of her room for the last week. She sobs and sobs and can't believe that the same man who was in ""Titanic"" would ever lower himself to this level. Neither can I. Parents -- avoid at all costs! I fear that Daphne will now get bulimia and live a shortened life.",0
"I was quite disappointed with this one. I usually love Stephen King, but I have to admit this was slow going. A girl is lost in the woods......with a lame ending. If you're looking to be scared about being in the woods....rent ""The Blair Witch Project"" and watch it by yourself at night. I'm just glad I borrowed this book and didn't purchase it. Stephen King has MUCH better books. Maybe next time..........",0

"Just a word of advice... a lot of people are reporting problems with Universal's new Monty Python's Meaning of Life DVD. Disc Two of the set is fine, but the movie disc is plagued by strange picture artifacts - blurring of movement, etc. It could very well be an encoding problem with the disc itself.",0
"I bought this thermometer for emergencies within the past year and when I was in a panic to check my sick baby's temperature in September, it did not work. The battery had died before I had a chance to use it! After the emergency passed, I went to several stores looking for a replacement battery. No one could match it to anything they carried. I found the same Vic's thermometer in the package on the shelf and could not find a battery type listed anywhere. The pharmacist could not assist me. Tonight with my glasses on and a 8x magnifier, I identified the model, but no battery type. Finally, I tried looking on Vic's website and still found nothing other than the bad reviews by other people who had similar problems. Rather than waste anymore time and money on this product, I will call this a loss and invest in a different brand thermometer with better reviews.",0
Rhino Vinyl is nothing but junk! I've bought albums from many different establishments and 3/4 of the Rhino Vinyl albums I buy new do not play in any of our turn tables. They skip all over the place and it's not listenable nor enjoyable. Even repurchases of the exact same album from different stores in different months have found to skip in the exact same spot. I will not be buying a Rhino Vinyl product again.,0

"I bought this and loved it at first. Then one day it just stopped working. It was stuck in a frozen state. So I called tech support and they replaced my machine. This one had the same problem when I took it out of the box! So now we moved onto the third machine, which seemed to work at first to my relief. One week later, the same problem again! This time, instead of wasting my time and patience, I just put it in the trash and now I'm shopping for a new brand. Beware; there is something wrong with this model. It's a great design but obviously it hasn't been perfected yet.",0
I thought that this USB headset would be a great solution to my audio needs. It wasn't! The headphones were operative but of poor quality.

"First of all let me state why I handed over my hard-earned money... I wanted a book written from a German perspective regarding the closing days of the war. I was hoping for first-hand personal accounts of the hell and desperation that those days brought. What I got was a very poor translation of a book that offered little, if any, ""soldier's stories"" and skipped wholesale details of what it was like living in the ""fortresses."" No mention is even made of the efforts at places such as Memel. Overall, it was a very disappointing purchase",0
Can't give a review on Maximum PC. Never received the magazine. Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM. Please send my Maximum PC.,0
"This repugnant insult that Steinbeck has slung upon his readers has nothing to recommend it except for the author's name. This short, nasty and brutish little tale is completely predictable, and I expect that this was the case when Steinbeck first foisted this on his unsuspecting public. It is only 90 pages, which means that the misery does not go on for too long. Teachers like to assign it, which no doubt helps explain the popularity of television among the adult population. (If this is ""Literature,"" then give me a nice ""ring around the collar"" commercial, please.) Although many people refer to small books as short and sweet, this one would be better described as short and shoddy. Our copy went on top of the junior high school's roof, where it doubtless is now enjoying the lofty station that it deserves.",0
"This book held promise, and I enjoy when a writer steps out of the familiar. Unfortunately, Cornwell should go back to thrillers. This was a collection of (mostly) cardboard characters in search of a plot. There was little character development, no threads tying it together, and the ending was ludicrous. I lent it to a friend and she says she will never forgive me or trust me again. I was very disappointed.",0
"Seems like a well made product but unfortunately it didn't work for my girlfriend... now ex... I guess it's just one of those things. It obviously works for some, but is definitely no miracle cure.",0

"Sigh...the previous reviewer should have watched the movie before reviewing it. You think ""ah! A farce with Leslie Nielson! It must be funny!"" based on The Naked Gun. Don't be fooled, though: this isn't an Abraham, Zucker & Zucker production, and it's not at all funny. Some tips for the writer: sexual innuendo in itself is not funny. It's only funny if there's something CLEVER about it. The same with movie references: you can't just ape an older film; you have to actually do something FUNNY with it. Nielson IS a naturally funny guy, I think, but even he cannot redeem this waste of celluloid. The only redeeming quality of Spy Hard is Weird Al Yankovic singing the opening theme, but it's just not enough.",0
"Surely Dr. Laura must be having a fit, what with Ms. Hughes abandoning her teenagers, causing them to become latchkey kids, just so she can selfishly re-enter the rat race. It's not all about YOU, Ms. Hughes, your role is as a mother to your children. Further, when you stepped down as advisor to the president a year ago to return to your family, it's clear now that you spent all that time writing a book! A book! And now, a year later, the book finished, you're returning to the White House!As Dr. Laura says, children (especially teenagers) are in need of parental guidance, and a stay-at-home mom whose focus is on THEM, not professional aspirations.",0
"Helprin borrows themes and images from many great books, but the result doesn't add up to a work of art. His rip-off of Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" is doubly offensive in that his crypto-fascist hero ends up going back into the war with a renewed sense of patriotic fervor, which goes against anything I have ever read of the true feelings of the typical WWI soldier by the end of the war. Helprin's use of ""magical realism"" is stale, and smacks of adolescent wish-fulfillment. One of the few books I have thrown away unfinished.",0

"I kept hearing about how The Darkness are winning awards and plaudits left, right and centre; about how they are this revolutionary sound that is rekindling rock. Pah! Give me a break!They are just glam rock rejurgitated. And poor glam rock at that! To compare them to such legends as Queen and AC/DC is a joke. They are clearly manufactured, hyped-up fluff. Granted, they are talented musicians, but they lack a real cutting edge. Their songs are hollow: peal off the flashy, shrill skin and there's nothing inside!And to all the people who go on about how great the lead singer's voice is... there's more to being a rock singer than just range! High range vocals are fine in the right circumstances, but they need edge and attitude. This guy sounds like a neutered cabaret singer! For reference on how it *should* be done try listening to Deep Purple, AC/DC, Rush, etc.If this is the latest revolution in metal then we're all in deep trouble!",0

"This book is so boring and predictable. The author's insertion of scientific knowledge is rather dull and elementary. It does not flow well with the story, she just puts an idea from general relativity theory in the middle of a paragraph without any intro or reference to it. This is a story of a mad woman who lives her life for the sole purpose of revenge and hatred toward her father, but the author does not really even clarifies the source of such strong emotions. This book is written very poorly, it's a mere anthology of facts, some made up story and lots of basic and painfully elementary scientific knowledge of the author.",0

"I was recommended by a friend to read this book, and I am never, ever listening to her advice again! This was a terrible piece of ""prose""! Shallow and poorly written, like a screenplay rejected from a bad soap opera pilot. Audrey, the protagonist, is a horribe wife, a horrible mother, and so lifeless and unreal that you want her to be slapped and locked up instantly!I couldn't finish the book, because with each chapter came more and more badly written storylines that failed to capture my attention.

It is supposed to motivate you, so I was going to use it as a morning booster of my energy and that ""feeling good"" mood. However, the author speaks as though he is just about to commit suicide from such a lethal depression or you can imagine him weighing 650 pounds lying on a bed not being able to hardly even speak. It actually was a so boring narration that I passed out. No energy. No motivation. No inspiration. Not at all. Get yourslef some Wayne dyer. BUT, I recommend you read the book.",0

"Canyons is an interesting book. It is about Brennan, a boy who lives with his mother. His father left the family when he was very young, and he has never forgiven him. Brennan liked to run around to free himself from all the problems he was going through. One day, Brennan went camping accompanied by Bill, his mother, and some children. It was then that Brennan found a skull. Later on, he realized that couldn't talk about the skull and somehow he felt attached to it...",0
I was pretty disappointed with this book - I had the murderer picked in the first 50 pages and found the overall story to be extremely predictable. I thought the characters were too simple; the good were very good and the bad very bad. There was very little depth or complexity to the characters or plot. This was the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it will be the last.,0
"This is the worst example of a sleazy quick-buck artist scamming the marketplace I've ever run across. The disc is unwatchable, even for a moderate fan of Bruce Lee, like myself. Apparently, they took someone's extremely worn out copy of a video tape and transferred it directly to DVD. I actually shut it off in the middle of the climactic fight scene because it was so bad. That was after having muted it to preserve my hearing from the hiss and squeals in the audio. My recommendation is to avoid anything from Madacy Entertainment, the perpetrator of this ripoff.",0
"Great at scooping up toys. Holds a lot of toys. Looks great. Falls off the wall at 2 am and wakes the baby up. The sticky on this thing is HORRIBLE.

"This book contains several different stories, totally unrelated. OK, so they each mention somebody in one of the other stories, but that's a big stretch to make them connected. I kept expecting them to come together at the end, but alas, you never find out what happened to the snottie after her first cruise, except that she became famous. The cats' plans are spelled out, but then what ever happened to them? (Not even an oblique reference later on.) A kidnapped girl has almost nothing to do with the confusing political intrigue that she shares a quarter of the pages with. And a battle shapes up for control of a government, only to be wrapped up abruptly in one page.The stories don't stand on their own and they don't fit together between the covers of one book. Only read it if you have already read other books by the author and want to see some scraps from the cutting room floor.",0
"I purchased a Sidewinder Force feedback Pro several years ago. soon afterwards Microsoft stopped supporting it. even for their own operating systems. It now sits in a closet totally useless except for win 98 systems. I have tried numerous times to find drivers or some way to make it work with any of the newer operating systems with no luck. All Microsoft has to say about it is that ""It is no longer supported"". I will never again purchase a product from them. Buyer Beware.",0

"Yes, Josh has taken a rock turn in his newest concert (even playing drums too). Thankfully I watched it on PBS because that's when I decided not to buy this one. A changed Josh Groban is reflected in the poor album sales. All other Josh Groban CD's hit platinum sales this release is not even on the charts, so it looks as if I'm not the only one who isn't buying and for good reason. I have the first CD and Closer. They're terrific. In this concert Josh Groban is pushed to the limit and his beautiful voice suffers.",0
"I was so looking forward to this book after reading all the positive reviews, but it was just completely implausible from beginning to end.

(Seems like it will make perfect ""summer blockbuster"" fare.)",0
"Bought this pair of sound isolating ear-phones after i had lost my pair of Shure E2C. Observing the high average rating of these phones, i thought that i'll give them a try. And I was really disappointed. The sound quality is marginally (if at all) better than the std pair of iPod headphones...and no where close to the Shure that i loved. I do realize that often people say that quality is quite subjective and dependent on individual preferences, but even my buddies didn't like it at all. Although they work great as ear plugs. I guess they may be good for others ...but for me I give it two thumbs down. I might have to return it or gift it to someone and get the Shure again.",0

"Carolyn P. Menial is a perfect example of what, in the terminology, is referred to as a wannabe, a lamer, or an AOL kiddie. Unfortunately, it often happens nowadays that people write books with no clue on the subject they are writing about. The sad thing is that there are dozens of even less-educated kiddies who will buy it. And they have, as Carolyn P. Menial's case proves. However, one thing amazed me: Carolyn P. Menial has of course no idea on any subjects concerning hacking, or, for that matter, on anything that concerns computer. Yet her command of what supposedly is her native language is even worse. Here we have an illiterate who at the same time is a lamer. And she writes books - and sells them! O tempora, o mores...To Carolyn P. Menial (at the moment posing as a ""Security Expert"" - sic!): publishing your daughter's data was an excellent move to hit you. May it eventually prove to be the least damaging one of all that attacks that you will hopefully suffer.",0

"This book is as scholarly and credible as the ""fair and balanced"" news coverage of Fox News which the writers shamelessly plug as their new found sinecure. The disaster that is American foreign and national security policy today is a direct result of these ethno-sectarian fanatics with connections to the Neo-Con Likud movement and the Southern Evangelical Armageddon churches. The vast majority of us Americans dont share their ethnic or sectarian affiliations and must work to defeat their use of our blood and treasure at home and abroad. If you want credible analysis on these issues read real ""experts"" and academics such as James Bamford, Anthony Zinni, Rashid Khalidi, John Mearsheimer, Richard Clark, or a dozen other writers outside this incestious cabal.",0

This movie hurts my head.Oh yea, the president can fly an f-18 why not.I kept routing for the aliens thru the whole movie. I hope this new DVD has an ending where the aliens win and kill everyone.

"I found this book so badly written (or translated, at the very least) that it actually made me angry. Such poor use of language, and the attempts at dialect were plain embarrassing. I only persevered reading it because of a friends' recommendation, and it got worse as it went on.The content of the story, if you could find it, was passable, and might even have made a good book! but the way it was delivered was a huge handicap. It is a very sad reflection on modern life and literature that women are so desperate for a discussion of womens' roles and relationships that a work so lacking in skill with language,structure and characterisation can become a popular hit.Perhaps these women have never read anything of lasting merit to recognize the truely mediocre (if not the execrable) when they see it.",0

"All that work, and out comes an apologia. No word, really, how the Habsburgs got to take over Spain. About the incredible inbreeding, including Philip's marriage to his niece, Anna of Ausrria, that needed papal dispensation. No indication that Don Carlos was a true schizophrenic, an inheritance from the daughter of Fedinand and Isabella and passed on in the Habsburg family for a few more centuries. The inquisition was a necessity, and the destruction of the armada an act of God? No matter how hard the author tries, Philip still comes across as a hesitant, pencilpushing pedant who was none too bright. Mr. Kamen should have studied Ludwig Pfandl's 1938 book; it descibes Philip correctly and encompassing from all sides. Illustrations: After talking time and time again about Philip's portrait by Titian - why does he not include it? As a historical study, this book is not adequate.",0
"I bought this juicer because it seemed like it had a lot of really good features at a good price, but it turns out that this is nothing like it is promised to be. They promise it will be whisper quiet, but it actually makes quite a bit of noise. It's actually NOT dishwasher safe, a fact I learned after taking it out of the dishwasher and discovering that it was now stained and had rough, peeling edges. The chute is only big enough to feed a whole apple into if that apple is the smallest one ever grown, and the juice spout is so low that you have to use shallow bowls to collect the juice. The kicker is that the plastic screw is extremely flimsy and broke within about a dozen uses. I'm in the market for another juicer, but I won't be getting another Jack LaLanne. This time I'll invest in something like a Breville that will actually WORK and KEEP WORKING.",0

"It is good to know that fifteen-year-old Ruth's mother and grandmother love her because I found her one of the most selfish, judgemental, and whiny kids I have ever met in literature. Carrie, the main character, gripes that her mother controls her, but her daughter is really in control. So what if her mom sleeps with her old heartthrob almost a year after her husband dies? How can this possibly affect Ruth except to remove her as the center of her mother's attention? And the reader, ""Goooodddd!"" I was a high school English teacher and I really don't think teenagers talk like this anymore. I will struggle through to the end of the audio version of this book only because I paid for it.

But then my daughter lost the battery door that covers the batteries and SD memory slots. It's just a little plastic slide in door...probably costs $0.01 to produce. But after spending many hours wasting time with HP's horrible customer support I now know that they will not sell me the part at any price. So my $80 camera is nearly worthless (yeah, we can use scotch tape to hold the batteries in). Anyway, the door is prone to fall off and get lost and HP isn't interested in solving the problem because there isn't enough $$$ in it for them. So don't buy it.",0
"The Royal Tennenbaums is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was advertised like a comedy and has an incredible amount of great actors in it. Well, I took my 26 year old daughter to see it, hoping to cheer her up ( she was suffering from depression ), well, guess what - that movie was a disaster. I don't recommend it. It doesn't deserve a star. Could you come up with a negative rating system, please ?",0
"Lars' side project appeals to me because it songs pretty much exactly like Rancid, and their first CD was pretty awesome, a solid punk album for all fans of Rancid. They were a safe haven from the transplants stuff and Skinhead Rob's rap. This record is not bad, in fact the music is actually really good and some of the tracks are legendary (1% and Skins, Punx, and DrunX).There is one problem, and it's BIG!The lyrics drive this album right into the ground. After the fifth or sixth song about prostitutes and how we're gonna screw them and then kill them, you're about ready to put this CD away for a long while. I agree with the guy who said that the album booklet was completely unneccessary, and even Tim Armstrong couldn't pull ""My Life to Live"" out of the fire.This is just mediocre, bottom line. I know punk lyrics are nothing deep, but c'mon guys, spend more than half of five minutes and write something at least decent.",0

The film concerns three unstable women whose lives are intertwined through Virginia Woolf's novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway."" There is no real plot and I could not sympathize with any of the main characters. The only character I could sypathize with was Kitty whose life was being taken out of her hands. Also, I didn't think it was possible for Julianna Moore to look unattractive, but this film managed it. I do not understand why this film has received rave reviews. For anyone who wants to see it, I recommend waiting to rent the DVD.",0

Many of the photographs selected were rather mundane and some of the captions questionable. As an example, a B-52 sequence is described as being the aftermath of a ""crash."" A close look at the photo shows ground equipment still hooked up to the ""Buff"" and it parked next to a hanger. Obviously this was some sort of a ground/maintenance mishap. Another shot shows an F4F Wildcat-not F6F Hellcat--against a carrier's island. I can never understand why books are published with detracting errors like this in them.I would have liked more descriptive text attached to the photos. What happened to the crew? What were the circumstances of the crash/mishap? Was the accident due to mechanical failure or human error?",0

"The disappointing ""Live at Carnige Hall"" seems to be the beginning of the end of Renaissance. The band's unwillingness (or inability) to show a little spontaneity in their note for note reworking of some of their songs suggested that the band was either beginning to run out of ideas, a notion that was sadly confirmed by its follow-up studio effort ""Novella."" The fatal flaw here is that the band seemed to be putting more effort on expanding the orchestral sound that worked so well on their two best albums, ""Turn of the Cards, and ""Scheherazade"" at the expense of writing actual songs. Sadly, ""Novella"" seems almost devoid of melodies that one remembers 20 seconds after the song is over (""The Captive Heart"" comes close). This is all pleasant, competent stuff, but ultimately it is an album that fails to excite.",0
"This film celebrates the lives of four women. I love that it's an old-fashioned film. I also love the interracial love story because diversity is a beautiful thing. I love how the women work together to support each other. Even though this is a film about African-Americans/Black-Americans, I think people from other races will be able to relate to this story 'cause they are females and love is one of the themes in this film. Unfortunately, there is racism and violence in the film, which stays true to history and the present century. It's a great film, but I returned it because of Alicia Keys. I no longer listen to her songs because she is a home-destroyer and she hates Nigerians. So I removed four stars because of her.",0

"This was a fascinating point of history where man versus machine may have finally reached a point where man is defeated in the one area in which he has always dominated: intelligence. The story is a great story to hear, but the video does not do a good job telling the story. The games are not covered in enough detail, one by one building anticipation. The producers use a whispering narration which is difficult to hear at best, and continually annoying. This could have and probably should have been a great DVD but it isn't, and it comes down to production: camera shots, music, uncomfortable face close ups, and a lack of game commentary and coverage. It is still interesting as the story itself is a turning point in history, but it could have been great.",0

I ahve read all of Henning Mankels books in English and have thoroughly enjoyed them until now.

I only like about 3 songs, cater 2 u, If, and looose my breath. If Destiny's child is gonna put out more crap like that they just need to dismember. Beyonce is already a star by herself, kelly has the potential to be with her beautiful voice, and Michelle....well i dont care what she does cause i dont like her voice anyway. But anyway dont waste ur money, just burn it from someone who already wasted thiers.",0
"I want to thank the people that reviewed this product as well. After buying the ""must have"" Jet City last year for my son who was 4 at the time it also fell apart. I think he was able to play with it 2-3 days max before it fell apart and the main piece broke( the airplane). My son was asking about the T-Rex for Christmas and my husband and I were both thinking no - I was double checking to see if this product was any better and it look like its not - I hope Hot Wheels starts to read these reviews.",0
"We have an H340 that is 3 months out of warranty. When its non user replaceable internal battery stopped holding a charge we were told that we now had a ""paperweight.""

"Be warned, I did not read carefully the downgrades rates related with this faulty DVD, it just stoped after 15 minutes or so and went back to main menu, it looped permanently....my only high point would be that it is now out of stock...so hopefully no more people would be stuck with this expensive frisbee... :(",0
I have worn Dearfoam slides for about 30 years. The last ones I ordered from Amazon.com are junk. They stretched out and started falling apart with just a few wearings and I only weigh 115 lbs so I am not hard on my shoes. The old ones I could wash and wear for at least a year. I will never order them again. Dearfoam has lost my business forever.,0
But they can't match the peerless genius of Nehemiah! I recommend the NRSV!,0
"Wuthering Heights is supposed to be a story about forbidden love, right? Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads. Wuthering Heights is defiantly not a thriller.",0
"This is a workman like effort by the author. The story, spy vs. spy is not a new one and you will not find anything memorable here. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. The author also tried to go down the path of the ""dark, brooding"" lead and he did not pull it off. Overall, this is not that great of a book",0
"Quick, someone call Jonny and tell him there's an imposter out there selling an album under his name! Lovers of Jonny Lang's past music will be disappointed in this recording. It ain't the blues! Jonny SOLD OUT for the money and I fell for it, don't you. This recording doesn't resemble past music by Lang. Maybe he hasn't suffered enough to feel the blues anymore, success has spoild his heart and passion. Maybe there's a spot for him with the Backstreet Boys, he no longer deserves to share the stage with BB King, Buddy Guy, Jimmy Vaughn, or even Dan Ackroyd. Come to think of it, this CD shouldn't be listed in the Blues catagory!",0
"I am tired of buying books which don't give any sort of clear solutions to the problems they are addressing. This book basically tells me what every mother and father already know. We don't need to know it will go away with TIME. To write a book like this and basically tell us what we already know should be a crime. I should have looked at it's ranking number before I bought it, I think that says enough.I did take one more chance and also bought Dr. Marc Weissbluths, ""Sweet Babies"", now that's a book that is worth buying and really what all parent's of colicky infant can use. Thank God someone knows what he is talking about!",0

"This album pales in comparrison to classics like Creatures Of The Night and Alive. I really would would not recommend this to anyone. Shandi, She's So European, What Makes The World Go Round, and Torpedo Girl really are boring. I really cannot say enough times that this album is weak. Buy another KISS album, or if not get into some other band. Really......don't buy this...",0
Most of the CD plays well but there are some scratches on it. I am kind of disappointed as this is the first used cd that i have bought that has scratches.,0
This Album is very much the same as his previous two. Alot of the gimmick dog bark is all over this c.d. I would suggest Still i rise by Tupac.,0
This book is required by my Mandarin instructor of a local university level Continuing Education non-credit course. Personally I do not find this book resourceful in my Mandarin studies as it is missing critical tone markers and particles in the vocabulary and sentence structures. The chapters are not very structured according to category as the author is not very detailed in writing this book. Too many gross visible errors!,0
"Doesn't smell like coconuts. Smells very synthetic, nauseatingly sweet and plasticky. Not at all how I imagined it would be. Can't recommend this one, not even for teens.",0
"If there is one problem I have with Julia Quinn, it is that she is milking the Bridgerton series for all that it is worth. The other books of the series were filled with light, love and laughter. This book is just depressing. It might have been good except for one detail. Like ""An Offer from a Gentleman,"" readers had no idea who the main character was. Francesca has always jsut been a sidenote, and Eloise's sidekick. When Quinn decided to give her her own novel, she should have given us a Bridgerton we actually wanted to care about. At least she gave Benedict depth and an interesting view on his life. The only noticeable thing about Francesca is her quietness. The book was bland boring and frankly a waste of any true Bridgerton fans time. I hope Hyacinth's book will be better",0

I have not been able to reinstall the game after deleting it per the EA support team's suggestion as I cant get past the DRM test on the fresh install. Thanks EA, but I will no longer rent/buy your games if you insist on this system. I am sure some pirate is happily playing this game while I am typing and staring at my retail box.",0
this film is two films in one.the classroom antics that make up Summer School and the CHemistry of Kirstie Alley&Mark Harmon.but the problem with this film is the typical cliches of School films in the 80's.,0
The show starts off great. Lauren Lee Smith for the first half hour is bewitching and hard to take your eyes off but then... it's over... by the end of the show she's just another whining jealous ex-lover pining away for her man.I have to give Eric Balfour a lot of credit for his lack of modesty. The scene where he is dancing naked with Smith needed a George Costanza voice over explaining the affects of shrinkage.All in all a horrible film and big waste of money.,0

"Even though 50 cent isn't a great MC i still expected much more on this album. Infact, i can't even lie but his first album ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" was actually a really good CD. 50 has gone further down the Ja Rule path, singing on almost every track and trading in much of the gangsta imagery which made him popular in the first place for a ladies man persona. He should have named this album ""Get Rich and Stop Tryin'."" A lot of Fifty's songs are deriviative of himself. Nothing on the album is outstanding even Eminem's guest appearance is lack luster. If you absolutely must have some Aftermath gangsta ish pick up The Game or Young Bucks. Avoid this album if you can.",0
"i saw anointed at toccoa fest, and immediately went and bought the album. i was disappointed, only enjoyed a few songs. the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping. dont waste your time and money",0
"I dont care what everyone else wants to call it, this cd is crap. Im pissed i didnt use my money for a better cd. I guess it would not be so frustrating if they hadn't of done such a good job with widow. But the rest of the cd is horrible.I dont understand how people can classify this as music when im sitting here, listening to over 4 minutes of erie tones. I think it would be wiser, less costly, and just as ""intriguing"" to buy the song on iTunes, and go buy a halloween cd with the erie tones on it. Overall, i just wish i could get my damn money back!My GradeF",0
"When I first got this as a gift I was happy to finaly have a DVD player, but two months later, I'm very unhappy. It has a lot of trouble reading DVD discs I rent from Blockbuster. My girlfriend's Sony on the other hand can read them all without a hicup. Then the VCR sort of stopped working, until I banged on the unit hard out of frustration one night. It's now working again, but I'm scared it'll ruin my high-grade videotapes. The paint in one corner is coming off; not from my bang, tho.! If I spent money to buy another one, I'd go with a Sony or Toshiba. This increasinly feels like junk quality.",0
"I haven't seen garbage like this since I lived in Italy. The cinematography is not too bad, and that's the best thing I can say about this film. I think it might have been made as late night filler for television rather than as a serious attempt. If it is a serious attempt, the filmmaker should stop trying to imitate EVERY successful Italian director and develop his own style. The subject is supposed to be shocking, but even that doesn't succeed. Dreadful.",0

"This is the worst electronic product I've ever bought. It does not deliver on its promise of ""adjustable gain up to 20 dB"" -- not even close. I used the signal checker supplied with my HDTV tuner and the most gain I saw was about 3 dB.The instructions tell you to turn the knob clockwise to increase the gain but they don't tell you it's a multi-turn pot (about 5 turns) without a hard limit (a slip shaft) so it's difficult to feel where in the range you are. Actually, the highest gain was about a full turn before the limit and would drop off to zero at the full clockwise setting.I also checked its performance visually, on several analog and digital TV channels, and saw no noticable improvement.It deserves 0 stars but Amazon doesn't let me select fewer than 1.",0
"I wasn't very impressed with this product, as it was difficult to get off and on. The absorbency was great though, so I guess this product might be great for some people. I didn't like it for myself or for my elderly father who was in a nursing home.",0
"This book reminds me of World War II propaganda. Believable, often-true facts are sorted and handpicked to support a one-sided angry argument.The author is so shrill in his invective, that all hope of discussion is lost. He offers no solutions, except to suggest a military coup on page 269.In the last paragraph, Johnson aptly worries that his demise might echo that of his role model, Hotsumi Ozaki, hanged by his country [Japan] as a traitor.",0
"I've had this headset for about two months now and although it was inexpensive, I wish I would have saved my money and gotten a more expensive one. I have it paired with my LG 8100. The static is horrible even when the phone isn't 30 yards away. I have the phone right in my pocket! People on the other end can't hear me and I can barely hear them. I always just end up cutting the bluetooth feature off and just putting the phone to my ear. This is my first ever bluetooth headset so I know I will have better luck with the next one I purchase. It couldn't possibly be any worse than this. So if you're interesting in it, please make another selection. Hope this helps:)",0
"This book is a joke. It is silly, self serving and I actually read it and wasted a good 4 hours out of my life that I will NEVER be able to replace. It was horrible.",0
I love mysteries--too bad this isn't one. The plot is extremely thin and there are no unusual plot twists that you would normally find in most good mysteries. I figured out who the murderer and the weapon was before page 50 (of a 200 page book). Even the romantic part was predictable. Don't waste your money!,0

A openign credits int he begining say it all. they really didnt try at all with this sequal. it was boring and i didnt laugh at all during the movie it was nothing but a complete waste of time.,0
"First, the whole album is mixed like a pop album. It's bright, sparkly, with the parts surgically detached, sounding anywhere from alternative (think: opening riff) to cardboard cut-out neoclassical. There is no sense of despair or dread. The vocals don't add to the atmosphere and seem rehearsed. I didn't delve into the lyrics because the music didn't prove engaging, but they're probably the high point here. One song reuses the line ""I cannot be your God."" (At least the ""I am the universe"" goth pretension isn't present.) In a single word, this release is lackluster. Even at an EP price, your money is better spent elsewhere.",0
"People.. I dont wanna ruin the party but this is just asking for trouble. I know I might be a hipicrit after this is over but whatever. For what I know, this recalls dead spirits. And this is a game? Ok. My late mother's cousin had a original version or something of this type. It was called a 'luigi' (or something like that)board. She was playing with this by herself. Not too long after that Gasoline was somehow put in the cabinet under the sink. She went in there and lit up a cigarette. She was burned alive. The only part that wasn't burned was a small piece above her forhead. Go figure. I repeat this is not a game. Stay away.",0
"Purchased DVD for husband's birthday. Gave it to him the evening of Dec. 27, 2012. We watched three of the movies. They were great. The fourth movie, Assination, was defective. The audio was garbled and the video was jerky. Would like a replacement if possible. Please advise.",0
"I liked the movie until it finally dawned on me how many lies are in it and how biased the story is against NRA members and gun owners and manufacturer's. It had excellent effects, but I don't appreciate the film makers, actors, and writers implying that I, as a NRA member and gun owner for 30 yrs, and Proud of it, am some sort of thug who condones selling guns to criminals. Hoffman and all the others who twisted this film (The book this movie is based on has nothing at all to do with guns) should keep their political agendas and bias out of the films, since some of the story plot is half-lies and some of the truth is (conveniently) left out. The effects a are good though and it has plenty of action. Still, I'll never rent it or watch it again.",0
"This is honestly the worst translation of a book that I have ever read, and I have read quite a few. Punctuation is missing, sentence structure is all but absent, and the end result is enough to make Kafka emerge from his grave and punish those who have so mistreated his work!I do not even know what to do with this book. It is impossible to read, too awful to donate to the library; and yet, I cannot bring myself to destroy it. Guess there isn't much to do except to leave it in some boring waiting room, somewhere- God knows the world is full of those. I hope to find a translation that will do justice to this master, but realize that I might have to order a French one to avoid any further mishaps. The French would never tolerate this variety of literary butchery; they would rather reinstate the revolution and the guillotine, than to release such a bastardized version of a great literary work to the public!",0
"This book does a decent job of outlining the 'principles', but fails to draw concepts together in a way that would make the subject more understandable to beginning chemistry students.",0
"I bought this book out of curiosity, since Coben is a bestseller and I like crime fiction. But this book was a disappointment. I won't spoil it for you, but the plot is very superficial and ingenuous. The protagonist lost his wife years ago and, suddenly, starts receiving misterious messages that may cast some light into her death. The idea looks interesting, but the result is not. My impression is that the autor started to wtite from the ending, and made up a story just to fill the pages. And the ending itself, supposedly conceived to amaze, in fact dos not add up with the protagonist's personality, as it is build throughout the book. If you are not experienced in crime fiction, you may find it entertaining. If you like more mature writing, try somewhere else.",0

"Just as I expected, I knew that there would be rabid fans labeling this affair with overwrought accolades. Ms. Thorn has produced much better work than this with EBTG and various guest appearances. But without the club beat-backed tracks too add some ""oomph"", this album would be one big snooze. And even the club tracks don't sizzle. There was nothing here that made me want to know what she was singing about. I just didn't care.Brilliant? Umm, I don't think so.",0
"I was so disappointed in this book, and the fact that I spent good money on it! Loved the movie, and am so grateful it wasn't peppered with expletives. By page 45, I'd had enough of the author's foul language, and threw the book out. No, I won't give it away, because I cannot recommend it. In addition to the offensive language, the author's excessive use of long parenthetical and wordy descriptions became difficult to wade through: too many extraneous details! The last two pages of the book sum up the author's petty and self-centered view of life and death; but that is what happens ""when you don't believe in heaven...""Julie & Julia",0
"I ordered this DVD for my husband who is teaching a World History class at a local high school. We love the movie itself, but the quality of the product was sub-par. There were several times during the movie when there was an annoying scratching sound that would continue for a while. I thought this was a new DVD and not a used one, but the annoying sound during parts of it causes me to wonder about that. The speed with which we received the DVD was right on! He did get it in time to use in his class. So that's a plus. Just wanted you to know about the quality of the video itself.",0
"Most of the questions in this game are ridiculous. The old trivial pursuit used to actually be about knowledge, but this anniversary edition asks questions you could not actually know the answer to, you just have to guess.

Most of our fun was had talking about how ridiculous the questions were.",0

"What the hell happened? I was misled into thinking this album was going to be great. I hope Bowie doesn't sing these songs tousher in the new year.

"A few years ago, a friend told me to check out something by Paul Theroux. Trusting his judgment, I took this waste of time out of the library and lost a few IQ points with it over the weekend. I have run across the author's name occasionaly since then in this or that newspaper (at least often enough to remember that he likes to refer to Henry David as the 'other' Thoreau). But then I read that his recent memoir skewers a good writer, VS Naipaul. Seems Naipaul let Theroux down somehow. From what I can remember of CHICAGO LOOP, cultivating his talent may have been Naipaul's unforgivable sin. This thing is awful. To be avoided at all costs. If you want a cop with a dark side, rent Clint Eastwood's TIGHTROPE. Or a Brian Dennehy TV movie. Either one's better than this crap...",0
"I am 56 years old, and an avid reader. I have often not liked a book I have read, but this is the first time I have ever wished I had not read one. It is a very derivitive book - a combination of ""Candide"" (to which the jacket reviews compare it) and John Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" (which they do not). If one has read these, one does not need to read this. The author, Sean Murphy, works hard on trying to impress us how clever he is, and fails miserably. What he deems as cleverness is, again and again, just ""cloyingly cute."" Two examples from just one chapter - the one he calls ""The Shape of Tuesday"" - calling the man who founded of an institute which studies time ""Julian Calendar,"" and, at a banquet which honors time having food seasoned with ""parsley, sage, rosemary."" PLEASE!!! And every chapter is like this. If zen, for you, means trite allegory and confusion, have at it, but, otherwise, avoid this book at all costs.",0
"I got one of these because it's what my mother and grandmother used to make applesauce. Boy was I disappointed! It didn't make it through one day of applesauce! After the 44th quart, the bottom that holds the spring on broke, and the lips on the edge that fit over the pan are bent so they are almost horizontal. And it didn't perform well up to the 44th quart either! It's a lousy construction that does not efficiently push the food through, leading to extra grinding, and extra force, which takes extra time. If I could get my money back, I would. My mom then gave me her ancient one, and what a difference! I'm able to grind a batch of applesauce in half the time! They don't make them like they used to.",0
"""Wish You Were Here"" sounds like an entirely different band from the one that made the classic ""Dark Side of the Moon"". That album was beautiful and kaleidoscopic.

A lot of people love this album, but I don't know why.",0
"Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off. For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).Cons: The toaster part is horrible. This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time. Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn't work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off. Also, the bottom rack is completely useless when toasting, so the fact that they are touting this as a 6-slice toaster oven is misleading.",0

The rest of the book I found to be extremely uneven, repetitious, and sometimes obscured by its own convoluted language. The bouncing from past to present was occasionally confusing, The ""Domenico"" papers were written very unevenly until I was saying to myself, is this the old man or the grandson talking here? I was not sorry I read the book, but it took me a long time, a chapter a day as it were, and ALWAYS I was wondering... (I am a writer) How did he ever get a publisher to read his original manuscript?",0

"Saunders is a writer that is working on a single theme, with singular energy. This is not a problem for a writer if he brings something fresh to the theme each time he tackles it. Saunders will sometimes do this, but more often than not, he fails. That is why some of the stories in this collection are brilliant, while others seem like derivatives of those moments of brilliance. Rather than bring us a fresh insight on the problems of fiction, Saunders seems content to simply reiterate. Saunders is the archetypical writer of magazine fiction: in between the slick covers of The New Yorker his work is a bold standout, but when you set his stories alongside each other in a volume, the record skips.",0

I think my Shun and Wustoff knives are far sharper than the Kyocera. Even when cutting a shallot I find there is more effort used with the ceramic knife than the Shun or the Wustoff. Although it does do a good job with tomatoes and vegetables. Meat and fish are pretty much the same as a metal knife.If I had to choose one knife to do all jobs,..it would be a non-ceramic knife and I would wash, hone and store immediately.If I could I would return the Kyocera.",0

"Unfortunately Paul Begala felt the need embellish terrifically damning facts regarding George W's business dealings, politics, and personal history with snarky comments and childish personal attacks. He assures us in the introduction this will not be a piece to round up support for Gore as he's perfectly capable of making his own case. Yet throughout the book, Begala holds up Mr. Gore as a paragon in both politics and intelligence. Made me kinda think of a one-sided internet flame war.I am a registered Democrat and couldn't abide by George W. before picking up this book. I was hoping to gain some insight into the workings of his mind in order to discuss his candidacy with certain misguided friends and family members ;) But this book was a disappointment and an insult to the reader. Shame on you Mr. Begala; you should have let the facts stand alone rather than trying to tell me what to think!",0

"This is no Gene R. story. The storyline is thin, and it throws away much of the Star Trek Cannon that has existed for decades. Why? Because Paramount hired a hack to direct and write this stuff, and the rest of the spineless Paramount parasites with no vision signed off on this film. If you are a long term Star Trek fan, you will be left asking, ""what happened""? If you have never seen a Star Trek movie, tv series, book, or recording, you may think this is good entertainment. However, the storyline is unsustainable, a very large flaw that Paramount overlooked while making this movie, and the very reasoning behind this movie will leave most Star Trek fans wondering who the heck thought this was a good idea. Bad science, poor character development, terrible scripting. Try and find the one character in this film that doesn't punch Jim Kirk in the face....",0
"We rented ""Rat Race"" and watched it today. At the start of the movie where establishing information is taking place we found it entertaining. Further into the movie the plot seemed to plummet. One scene after the other failed to appear funny to us. More like distressing. Yet, we like ""Kingpin"" and ""Wrongfully Accused"", ""Spy Hard"" so we were expecting to like ""Rat Race"" -- too much of the humor and plot derived from material such as WWII and animals and transplants just wasn't funny to us. The ending was entertaining to an extent. We thought we couldn't go wrong with the great cast of ""Rat Race"" and unfortunately we were disappointed to discover it just wasn't grade A comedy. Sorry, but the rental expenditure was more than enough for this particular movie.",0

"I recognized the movie was an attempt at Dune with the sand, Arakis, and the giant worms, but poor acting, stupid costumes, poor acting again, and blood and sexual themes all over the screen.

"Keyes is a skilled and eloquent rhetorician, and much of his analysis of African-American communities is right on target. Unfortunately some of his conclusions seem illogical. While an intelligent argument can be made against the wellfare state, operating from the Republican party is nonsensical given it's historic opposition to civil rights.If Keyes' supposition is correct, that education and moral strenght are what lift people out of poverty, then welfare needs to be replaced with a monumental effort on the part of the federal government to provide equal funding and support to every school in every community. Republicans have consistently opposed equality in education, to the detriment of African-Americans and other minority groups.Keyes could further his cause much more effectively by working within the Democratic party which is much more inclusive and tolerant not only of racial diversity but of education and difference of ideas...",0

"Unless you happen to already be a math PhD or child prodigy, do not listen to the 4 and 5 star reviews. For us mere mortals, this is a terrible textbook. Instead of laying out proofs as formulas, almost everything is in paragraph form. In addition, the author has a terrible habit of saying ""Given premise A, one can easily come to conclusion Z"" with no mention of steps B through Y. This is not for the problems marked difficult at the end of the chapter. This is the first thing that he will say at the introduction of a topic. Do yourself a favor and look at Springer's undergraduate math series books in partial differential equations. Also, you can google ""Paul's Math Notes"". This will at least give you the basic introduction you need to understand the heat, lagrange, and wave equations.",0

Actually, health is almost always attined by studying diseases and figuring out what causes them. I didn't read this book because I wanted to get rich, but if you want to get rich, I would recommend you change your worldview. His understanding of ""rich"" is more like ""happiness"" and he gives a 100% guarantee. It reminds me of tonics and cheap marketing. He also pushes a lot of Hindu principles, essentially like cultivating your good karma. I guess Hinduism was pretty new and revolutionary for people in the early 1900's, but I suspect this author's other books on health and happiness are nearly identical to this one.",0

"Gilliam uses Alcoholics Anonymous and her negative inference about it as the means to draw a readership. She is full of extreme tunnel vision, narrow minded and offers little to show for her alleged achievements. It is more a self serving endeavor than a mechanism to offer a view of various options for a broad range of people suffering from alcoholism and substance abuse. Repeatedly she says what did not work for her in Alcoholics Anonymous and never mentions the myriad of successes in AA by folks who are atheists, agnostics, feminist, professional and intellegent thoughtful people. Her use of stats and numbers are dubious at best. It was a worthless endeavor, except as a story of one woman's visceral angry response the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and tons of self endulgence. BORING.",0

Although I played it with my friend before a movie for half an hour, it proved to be a pathetic game.It was simply unentertaining. In the begginning you fight wolves and snakes. The problem is when a wolve spots you, he charges at you, and you can't get the freaken wolf away from you. you can't punch, because you'll die first. You can't run because your too slow.The controls were kind of sloppy. and there was nothing too special about the graphics.",0

"Oh for Lord's sakes. I can love a drama, but not when it hits all my hated M's -- Maudlin, Morose and Morbid. This overwraught sobfest features Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts as mom and stepmom respectively, working together to build a stable environment for the kids under trying circumstances (illness, kids' hostility towards Julia, Julia's busy career, a dad/husband who raises his voice, but can't lift a finger). While the premise is admirable, the result is lots of overacting and overreacting from the usually watchable Sarandon and Roberts. This is not a reason to spend your money -- a renter at most, if ever I saw one.",0

"I don't normally write reviews, but this book moved me to take action. This book is profoundly disrespectful of its audience. It is utterly sophmoric. This might pass a high school economics course, but it fails as serious scholarship or analysis on any other level. The writing style is immature, hysterical, and hyper-dramatic. The facts are anecdotal, and she fails to construct an acceptable cause-effect dynamic. She trots out disparate and unrelated factoids to support her thesis, vice structuring a scientific argument, collecting and organizing available data, observing the phenomenon, and letting the data dictate the conclusion. I was profoundly disappointed by this book.Avoid this book at all costs.",0

Not to mention detailed insight into creating e-mail applications for the Internet. What I received for my money; a book 'padded out' with unecessary code listings, instructions on creating a browser using a ready made wizard that did all the work for you, (followed by pages and pages of the code contained within the app.) and e-mail applications that were nothing more than Mapi calls to initiate parts of the now dated Microsoft Exchange component. Indeed, the first task in this chapter was to make sure that you had Internet mail already installed and working in Exchange.The book commences by informing its reader that previous VB knowledge is assumed, then spends the next chapter crawling through very elimentary introductions to VB.All in all a waste of money for me, I really wish I'd never ordered it.",0

"The Anchor Bay version from 2001 is currently the best you can do with this title. I had high hopes for the new release, but was suspicious based on the awful cover art. Sure enough, they have a super-low bit rate, are actually zooming on the image in some areas and have problems with no English subtitles on some of the extras (the film is in French). I've shown the Anchor Bay version to friends in the last few years all of whom have been impressed by this clever caper from 1981. But when a company comes out with a new version (seven years after the last time Diva was released on DVD) it deserves a whole lot better than this. I second the call for the director of the film and whoever owns the rights to get it the heck away from Lion's Gate so Criterion or some decent production studio can take a crack at it. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION.",0

"I really think that this perfume smells like ammonia after a while. At first it smells like roses, then like cat pee. Yuck. I've tried it several times to make sure that it was not just a weird fluke, and it really does remind me of cat pee. It is like one of the low notes in the perfume smells like ammonia. I also don't think it is just that the fragrance does not mix with my body chemistry, because it does the same thing on clothes.",0

"umm, i ordered this because i thought i would be a perfect hat to stuff my hair under... turns out it won't fit on the head of anyone! Trust me, I was upset it would not fit over even half my head so I made a point to have almost every one I know try it on....conclusion: the only person it would fit on without cutting off circulation was my buddies 2 month old baby!!! no joke.., but this hat certainly is...

"This cd is not even worth 50 cents because its just like every other trendy and commercial garbage out today.The beats are too simple and the lyrics are full of the same old gangster nonsense.This guy is so over rated and talentless that I cant even begin to descibe.Many of the mindless mtv sheep will be buying this,but if your original and like good music you will skip this trash.DO NOT BUY THIS CD.",0

"I actually bought the game and I have to admit that the concept is cool but the activation is lame and I'm bummed that eventually I'll probably run into the inability to play it without using the cracked version. I was also kind of bummed that some stages of the game are so short...it seems there's less flexibility than I imagined.Cheers for a good concept, hope you drop the cheesy-legitimate-buyer-thwarting DRM for Spore II!",0
"I, too, have had nothing but trouble from this timer. It worked fine for the first month or six weeks, although as others have noted the buttons are excessively debounced and have to be pressed and held to function. After that initial period of unenthusiastic mild satisfaction, however, it began to ""freeze"" sporadically and, more recently, continuously. Even the kids now know how to remove the battery cover, take the battery out for a few seconds, and replace it to reset the timer. I ordered a new (different) timer today, and figured I'd stop by here and leave this review while I was thinking about it. Avoid this thing.",0
"As a long-time fan of Tom Clancy, I find myself incredibly disappointed with his latest offering, The Bear and the Dragon. Weighing in at just over 1,000 pages, the book is filled with page after page of ""thoughts"" as opposed to good, old-fashioned dialog-""thoughts"" so replete with poorly written, misogynistic, right-winged conservative diatribes that it renders the book all but unreadable.I can't help but thinking that 1) Clancy has completely lost touch with the reality in which the rest of us live, and 2) the man is simply using his novels as a pulpit from which he can preach his views and beliefs. I encourage everyone to save their money and look elsewhere for a good thriller.",0

"This book is a reference, definately not an instructional book. I'm not sure who they had in mind when they wrote this. I have an excellent grasp on C++, and knew a little bit about MFC and windows programming. However this book shows pages and pages of code with very little (or in many cases no) explanation of it. It assumes you already know MFC! Of course if you already know MFC why the hell would you be reading this. No matter how good you are at C++ no programmer can look at a function call (with no defintion) and just guess what it does, and apparently thats what the author's of this book want you to do. Instead of reading this I've been reading Wrox's ""Professional MFC Visual C++ 6"". It's a much better book simply because it ACTUALLY EXPLAINS THINGS!",0
"While I think it's great that two young guys could win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, I was so disappointed in this movie. The only thing I enjoyed about it was Robin Williams. The rest of it was boring; I found myself reading a magazine and picking up a Sue Grafton novel while my boyfriend watched in earnest as Will kicked some guy's butt and smarted off to his court-appointed shrink.",0
"If you are a fan of the 1976 bicentennial series by Jakes you will think he has become mentally feeble and lost all writing ability. If you are a history buff you will abhor this book. If you are a first time reader of the Civil War and think darkies sang zippidy doo dah through their slavery you will LOVE this book. I believe Mr. Jakes has lost his perspective on history and is just tired of writing but writes because he has a ""name"". Sometimes it is just best to stop until you have an epiphany or just stop because the well is dry. I would advise Civil War readers to pass this one by. I am donating my copy to the library.",0
That's right this disk is in MONO with the exception of just two songs. These were recorded in the mid 1960's when stereo was in full swing. I know for a fact that Winchester Cathedral was recorded is stereo because I have it in stereo from a compilation CD of various artists that I bought in the past. It does bother me that these companies release these in a half hazard way.,0
"As a text book, this book will drive students crazy. Despite the typos which can be found not occasionally, I found the authors wrote most of the examples using large paragraphs but hard to comprehend.Pretty often the results they generated comes from nowhere. No clear deduction, some times even no equations, just tell you some meanlingless number. The authors must have treated students as experienced as they are, therefore they omit most of the important details for a student to follow. Obviously, by using computer software, they can easily get answers from problems they made without bothering write down how they can get it by pencil and paper.My suggestion is that if ever you want to learn some statistics, get some books which are clearly written and well illustrated. This book is obviously overrated.",0

"This book was given to my 2 year old son as a gift, and is the only book of his that I detest.The story is simple: a beautiful, vain fish is shunned by his fellow fishes for not sharing his rainbow scales. So he does, and by the end of the book all of the fishes are swimming around with one shiny scale - uniform, boring, conformed. The poor fishes look moronic with their one shiny scale each.I felt a real sense of sadness - instead of learning to live with differences and and to embrace them with humility, beauty is destroyed for the sake of equality and conformity.",0

"I'll be honest with the reader of this review. I could not finish this book. The author had definitely missed the spirit of the original story, the personalities of the characters, especially of Erik himself. Further, although the author obviously had done some research into the history of the period, he had apparently not read much of the literature of the period because he missed the ""voice"" of the period. By that I mean, the way that people spoke and what they spoke of. His characters spoke as if they lived at today, not the late Victorian period. In short, he did not understand the culture of the time. Do your self a favor. Don't read this book. (You might try Angel of the Opera instead, especially if you happen to also like Sherlock Holmes).",0
"I was very upset and disappointed when I discovered that the dvd was not viewable in our region. We live in the USA and not in Japan, Europe, etc!!!

"Compared to his dynamite album releases in the 1970's, Barry White's musical talents have taken him in a slow downward spiral. Years ago, he used to belt out his husky, sexual voice whether it was an inspired, up-tempo love song, or something slower. His voice ""ran the show"" back then, and commanded attention. It doesn't anymore. Now lackadaisical, hypnotic instrumentation (dare I say dull and boring) rules over his music. This guy was so capable of putting out better music. You know Barry's creative juices have run dry when he includes the remakes of ""Low Rider"" by Eric Bourdon & War and ""Thank You"" from Sly & The Family Stone on this album. It is such a shame. Bring back the old Barry music from the 1970's....that was truly his best stuff. This 1999 release is just fluff. About as memorably exciting as watching paint dry on the wall.",0
The title of my review basically sums up what i view Powerman 5000 to be.Nothing here is new and authentic.Nothing is fresh and invigorating.Sure i do dig bands that sound similar to many other bands(so sue me).Yet Powerman 5000 have taken the sound of Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie and emulated them.It's not only the copying of sounds which causes me to dislike this release it lacks emotion and sounds dry and contrived.Many bands can pull off emulating another bands sound and still sound fresh and happening but unfortunately folks Powerman 5000 fall flat!!,0

"I am kicking myself every day for not doing IVF, as that is the only secure way of getting the gender you want. Everyone I knew suggested not doing IVF and I was not really excited about pumping my body full of hormones. We also thought of trying spinning, but it was not an option, because we didn't have a child yet. My husband and I really wanted a son, I have never wanted more than one child and have never had any interest in having a daughter, so we tried this method and practiced every suggestion in here by the book. I was skeptical with good reason. About 3 weeks ago they deterimined that we are having a girl and I have been having a really difficult time with it. If you really care about having a child of a certain gender, I suggest that you either try IVF or spinning if you have the financial resources. The Shettles method lacks substantial controlled scientific research and I would advise everyone not to rely on it.",0

"It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his ""Oregon Files"" series. This was terrible! I couldn't even finish it. I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read. It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open. Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better.",0

The label that is infamous for taking brilliant classic 80's and New Wave, sucking the life out of it, and trying to reinvent it as uninteresting, dismal, gothic ,karoke crap, is back with yet another collection of diss-asters. Cleopatra should concentrate on developing and nurturing young new and classic goth and synthpop bands, and leave the classics alone. Sadly, a great label gone straight to Hell, just like this compilation of crap. 0 Stars.",0
"I was disappointed in this novel. The writing was clumsy and forced, and this proved to be distracting in many instances. The book was full of poorly researched technical info (Versed is an opioid??), mock-heroic and comic-book villain dialogue, and seemingly endless contrivances designed to stretch the plot out to over 600 pages. It did not approach the quality of the Bourne novels. There was some fairly interesting dialogue and information about the moral conundrums faced by both Germans and Jews during the holocaust, and at times I really liked agent Navarro. But these good points were overwhelmed by the overall silliness of one yawner of an action sequence after another. I became so tired of this that I skimmed the last 100 pages, unable to focus any longer during a time that should have been the most riveting.",0

"This is exactly how I predicted it would be- an uninspired hollywood-ization of a true classic.Now, Hollywood is not all bad. Some of the recent remakes have been made well, with heart, like DAWN OF THE DEAD. TCM, however, is a typical modern blockbuster horror film meant to screen three or four weeks, bring in an easy 50 million, and that's that.It irks me that they had to do it to a classic. I gave it an honest chance, and it had its moments, but when all was said and done, it flopped. Using the TCM title means that you are to undergo more scrutiny then if you were to release something like this under a different name.Typical teen slasher flick.",0
"I really like the way this little compass looks; it's easy to read and seemed as though it would be very handy. I'm a kayak fisher and clipped it onto the front of my PFD for quick reference. Unfortunately on the first trip out the plastic holding the compass to the pin broke and the compass fell off and rolled around the yak. It still works fine, but no longer has a pin attached. I can keep it in the pocket of my PFD now for reference if needed - but if I wanted something more durable, clearly, I'd have to spend a lot more money.",0
"I had high expectations for this book. I have read many of the dragonlance series. It possessed none of the ""magic"" that made the dragonlance books great. The characters were shallow.

Too bad pitchshifter changed so drastically. Their first few were really good.",0
"In ""Taming The Tiger,"" you can still recognize Joni Mitchell's voice even though it's darker now by age and cigarettes. She works to get the characteristic lilt and lightness in her voice now with whispers. The songs, however, are middle-age circumstance, lyrics right on the money and touching a familiar chord with anyone over 40. But for a legendary songwriter who has been so prolific over more than three decades, ""Taming The Tiger"" comes up short, literally -- it's LP-length (44 minutes), including a totally uninspired instrumental, ""Tiger Bones,"" (length 4:22) plus the worst CD technical indexing mistake I've ever heard on a compact disc -- 50 seconds of nothingness between tracks 10 and 11. It may be symbolic of a work from Joni that's simply too little, too late. David Henderson",0

"Comfortable to wear, but the microphone was absolute crap.It was composed of a hollow metal tip with a hollow plastic tube leading up to the earpiece. There were no electronic components leading down to the mouthpiece, and I fail to see why it was even there. The microphone receiver was located INSIDE the earpiece, and when it did manage to catch the odd sound, it put itself in an endless loop - any noise coming out of the earpieces was picked up by the microphone.Since I bought this FOR the microphone, it was entirely unusable. It's currently being sent back to Amazon for a refund. Mine might have been a fluke, but I won't be trying these headphones again. Instead, I got a Cyber Acoustics AC-645 stereo headset w/mic and have been very pleased with it these past few weeks.",0
"this book gives me a major headache. unfortunately, it's assigned material for an intro database class i'm taking. as a business, not computer science major, I find this book to be overly complicated with too much verbiage. this is an intro book, it should be simple, yet it reads like a math book. just explain the simple concepts and not go into elaborate detail with terminology and database mathematical concepts. this book is geared toward hard-core techies. if at all possible, save your money for an easier and more entertaining book, not a dry, boring, incomprehensible one. alright, now that i've let out my frustrations, i'll get back to studying this book now for the upcoming final. wish me luck. i'll need it!",0

"I watched this movie originally due to Ellen Page, who is one of my favorite actresses. This movie was the worst feature I have seen in a long time. Ellen's character goes on some sort of crusade to torture a pedo (including castration.) Her character goes from bad to worse as the movie goes on. As always, she does an amazing job in the roll; however by the end of it you hope the man who was supposed to be the villian will win. Most movies I buy I buy with the intention of watching more than one time. However, the one time I watched this was quite enough, and I truly could not make it through it again. Thank God Ellen has moved on in her career because this film could have truly damaged it.",0

"I read Mary Jo Putney's novels during my Regency period 20 or so years ago. I'm now into fantasy and noticed this title. This was really a disappointment. I almost stopped reading halfway through it was so bad, but I wanted to know in how she wrapped it up. I didn't read the first book in the series since the reviews were not as good as this one. I certainly won't now.The problem seems to be that Ms. Putney is just doing it for the money and not from a writer's perspective of weaving story lines and characters together. The plot lines seemed contrived and just thrown in. I laughed out loud (not in a good way) at the unicorn and virgin. There were also discrepancies. Her heroine was strong and learning new skills until each time she ran into the bad guy when she seemed to regress. It wasn't very logical.The author would also throw in random bits of history as if to make the book more worthwhile. It didn't work.",0

"To make this as quick and as painless as possible, the movie was a huge letdown. Keanu Reeves look like he was just going though the motions here and delivers a rather stale performance that is the worse one in the entire film and that's a great feet considering that Shia LaBeouf, gives a painfully unfunny performance as his pet sidekick. Rachel Weisz is great but she's stuck with Keanu way too much and she would have been much lead than he was because she at least made you care about what was happening with the film while Keanu was just playing his Neo character again. Djmon Hounsou is fine but wasted in a bit part and Peter Stormare is criminally underused in a cameo.The special effects are great but there is really no story to be told and the script is pretty bad in some parts.Avoid.",0
"This book aims at a good target: explaining EAI to managers. To accomplish this task, the author needed full descriptions of the concepts and meaty examples to illustrate them.

Nowhere does he describe what is missing: what functionality is hard to access in SAP that should be easy?Save your money.",0

"This movie is nothing without the special effects. It's yet another movie which attempts to make people believe that the odds in Normandy were against the Allied Air, Sea and Land Machine. The Germans didn't have more than one plane over the Normandy beaches during the entire invasion. Even if the Germans had quicker panzer support it is hard to believe that the invasion would have had a different outcome. At least the movie does show that the allies were just as brutal as the axis when it came to war...But here too, Spielberg trys to make it acceptable for the allies to murder prisoners, but a war crime for the Germans to do the same. The Nazi Ministry of Propaganda under Goebbels was never as capable as Hollywood under Spielberg. See Stalingrad or the Winter War instead. I'm really tired of Spielberg getting rich off of German bashing.",0

"This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the ""Others"", who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!",1
"al green is god,no doubt about it, but he didn't always sing the best songs. ""explores your mind"" is a great example: of course ""take me to the river"" is a classic up-tempo gospel-tinged hit, but it's not my favorite. i like al green best when he's in that sexy mid-tempo love groove that made his best songs like ""tired of being alone"" so timeless. this album has two of those: ""sha-la-la (make me happy)"" and ""i'm hooked on you."" the price of the CD is worth it for just these two songs. i mean , as great as al is, i really don't care for ""the city,"" nor do i care for most of the songs on this one. anyway, if you love al's voice--and who doesn't?!--you might not be as picky as me.either way, the cover and title are cool, and al is, yes, god.",1

"The plot isn't fabulous, but the dancing is phenomenal! and there are some funny scenes. Defintely worth watching, especially if you like dancing along with your movies.",1
"This is a wonderful story with sensational illustrations that should be excellent preparation for a first visit to an art museum. The story is simple, and without introducing too many ideas, keeps children totally engaged with the characters. George Hallensleben's pictures are a compelling way to help children see a new visual world.",1
We have enjoyed previous issues and purchased this one to continue the set. We are not disappointed and will purchase other issues as well.,1

"This book was wonderfully written, and lets your imagination take over, to create your own preception of Offred's future. However, the end leaves you unclear and with questions.......very very powerful reading. Could it be a warning?",1
"I'll try and be brief. David lynch, along with Peter Greenaway, is probably the best director of our time. Thanks to him, cinema really goes forward, introducing new and uncommon narrative and multi-dimensional characters.His fiction, then, gives us to try and reconstruct a plot, feelings and characters, which is a unique and wonderful experience.Grasping reality is not an easy matter. Instead of giving us straight forward answers and certainties, David Lynch, as a real artist,unveils the complexity of life and human relationships. I 'd also like to say how wonderful Naomi Watts is. She is the one who brings life to Betty, the multi-facets cornerstone character of 'Mulholland Drive'. This film is so different from what we are used to seeing, so subtle, clever and exciting that anyone owning a dvd player should buy it.",1
"Jodi Picoult tells more than a love story in this book. ""The Pact"" is an eager unravelling of a relationship and of a love unlike any other. Emily is shot on the first page and subconciously leaves behind a chain of unanswered questions, doubts and lies. Through a series of police investigations, Chris interprets their story, painting a moving story of a ""suicide pact"" between them. Yet in the end, a different story is told. It evolves into a truth no heart could fully know; it is really, an unfathomable truth of love.",1
"Sydney Morning Herald:Headline: ""Black deaths, black lives""""... unless there's something I don't know about, Philip McLaren's excellent Scream Black Murder is still only the second crime fiction novel by an Aboriginal writer.""""Some of the incidents had me thinking, 'this couldn't possibly happen in Australia', then when I thought about it a bit more, I realised how naive I was being.""... Scream Black Murder is a superb novel that's both tough and tender. In it we're presented with a straight-from-the-shoulder novel of criminality that's as evocative and powerful as Walter Mosley's series about the black ghettos of Los Angeles. High praise but McLaren deserves it.""",1
I have owned several can openers and none has lasted very long. I have high hopes for this one. It seems very sturdy and opens even the biggest cans without tipping over. Cleans easily and latches onto cans with ease. The dark red color is a nice accent on the counter.,1

"This is a very sturdy light with an exceptional feel. The light emitted is extremely bright but in a diffuse manner. This does not produce a far reaching beam. Rather, it floods an area with evenly spread wide angle light. Much of the light is actually washed out when working near city street lights. Yet, in a truly dark enviroment, it floods a wide area with very impressive results. However, if a far reaching beam is what you desire, then your money would be better spent elsewhere.",1
"I've had this before, so I knew what to expect... Love this stuff. must like seaweed paper in order to enjoy it!!! Yum",1
"'Mean High Tide' is the sort of book intended to entertain and nothing more. It's not meant to be fine literature, nor will it be one of those book you'll remember long after finishing it. But its story of murder and mayhem in the Florida Keys and aquaculture run amok is funny, sometimes violent yet never gross, and the characters are all quite believable. This is my second book by James Hall and I can now say I am a fan.Bottom line: the perfect book to bring for your Florida vacation. Recommended.",1
Darkness Falls is one of the best horror flicks out there and it has its jolts and chills within the movie!!!!!! A tooth fairy witch is out to kill everyone in Darkness Falls!!!!! The only way to stay alive is to be in light and you have to stay out of darkness!!!!!!! If you want a really good scary movie then go check out this movie!!!!!!,1
"Ms McCrumb did an excellent job! Her book is entertaining, informative (regarding the history of the Appalachians), and her prose was a joy to read. Other reviewers didn't appreciate her style of going back and forth between the past and present characters, but I thought it worked well into the story, and gave the novel another dimension. After reading Ghost Riders, I plan to read Ms McCrumb's other books; as I really enjoyed her writing style.",1
"The only issue I have is that the text is not self pronouncing, simply meaning there are no punctuations that help a reader correctly pronounce words in the text. This is more of an issue in the Old Testament.",1
"I think, or I glean, that American high school students are required to read this book, held up as a shining example of national literature. Perhaps because I'm not American, this novel wasn't on any lists when I studied English in high school and university. Just as well; I mightn't have appreciated it then.It's understandable that The Great Gatsby would be taught; it's damned good. It's tight, compact, linear, and practically every sentence is a work of art. I bought the audio book and listened to it twice. Then I picked up the novel and read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; there's no way around it. It's also rather different from Tender is the Night, also good, perhaps more evolved, but not nearly as flash or impactful.If someone employed Fitzgerald's style today, their prose would likely be labeled too ornate. A shame, because it's poetic and powerfully descriptive.Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World",1
"This is great laptop raiser for a few reasons, I have been using mine since 2005 and have bought a few for friends. It works very well because it raises the laptop about two inches at the back making the viewing angle much better which saves my neck and shoulder from getting cramped. The only problem is that it is hard to find it in stores in Canada.",1
"I purchased this printer to replace an HP895 that I used for printing photos, after reading the reviews and trying it myself, I agree that the best results are from Canon Paper, but since I had about 50 sheets of Kodak paper laying around I thought I would see how good it could print with Kodak paper. ...",1
The Epistle to the Romans by Douglas Moo is an exceptional indepth review by chapter and verse of the book of Romans. This is a must read for Christians serious about their responsibilities as belivers of the faith.,1
Sound quality is the greatest. This changer replaces the exact model I had before. I use it everyday for up to 8-10 hours. So it gets a workout Amazon's price was right and shipment was quick. My husband had set up the new system in a few minutes. Thanks for carrying this model.,1
"I'm NOT a fan of Spike Lee at all and had I known this was one of his movies, I NEVER would have rented it. However, I now take that back because this movie is amazing. I've had this movie on my ""list"" for years and finally got around to renting it. Not to ruin it but the best scene of the entire movie, and that moved me to tears, is a key moment between Ed Norton and Barry Pepper towards the end. Barry Pepper does an absolutley amazing job in this movie. I think Ed Norton is a superb actor but I didn't think he was right for this role. But his dad was great, that was another touching story line. And the dog, as an animal lover, that got me too. Highly recommend this movie.",1
"We bought this for our 24 month old son as an Easter gift. I absolutely love it. Comes with everything I need. Paints are VERY washable. The smock it super cute. I am very pleased with it, as is my son.",1
"This is by far the best music documentary/movie I have ever seen! Even if your not a Rush fan this would be entertaining. the documentary was done well, with a lot of info. about the band + the music and old live footage is just awesome!I would have bought this just for the special features!",1
"My friend owns this, after he bought and returned the similar Samsung version.It is excellent, with good sound and easy to navigate controls.It stores A LOT of songs. It places them into categories, making it easy for you to find the exact song you want.FM Tuner is also included.You can upload pictures to this iRiver, and view them when you are listening to music.It comes with a rechargeable battery that has a huge battery life.If i needed 20 gb, I would get this, but I plan to get a 6 gb Creative Zen.Last Word:Best 20 gb mp3 player out there.",1
"If you're excited about a surge supressor, it's time to unplug and get out of the house*. That said, this is good & sturdy, has a long durable cord, lots of outlets in various orientations for the weird plugs (crazy cell phone chargers, etc), and a section for things that always need to be on regardless of the power button. Cord organizer seems useless and unnecessary, but is removeable. It's a tad big, but if you're looking for something with a lot of outlets, this is the one.-n-*then why is he writing this review in his free time, you're thinking. i don't have an answer for that.",1
"I received my new Holy Bible very, very fast and am totally delighted with it. I am very satisfied with the service and will order again",1
"I love this movie!! Yes, I realize it has very hokey ""monster songs"", and has some poor acting, but tha atmosphere is great, there's no blood and little violence, and the overall effect is to creep you out if you think about it while driving down a lonely country road. That poor kitten!",1
I got this Pack at the beginning for the Spring season and it has worked out great. Very easy to navigate and plenty of space for everything you'll need. I definitely recommend this bag!,1
An excellent day to day reporting post 9-11. Bob Woodward shows how the planning as well as the unexpected took place as America prepared and executed its war against Al Queda and Taliban in Afghanistan. The author draws from personal conversations he has had with the President and his war cabinet. However he doesnot dwell on any of Foreign Policy implications of the different decisions or the lapses of intelligence that led to 9-11.The author clearly brings out the different opinions of the different personalities involved mainly between the Sec of Defense Don Rumsfeld and Sec of State Colin Powell with Condi Rice being a moderating influence and reality check.Overall a good book which I would recommend to understand how the US military and intelligence agency plans and executes one of the strangest and unorthodox wars that US has ever fought.,1
Linkin Parks second effort will meet the expectations for a large portion of their fan base. It is not as strong as their first album. I may attract more new fans but the difference between the two albums is that Linkin Park tried to overcreate their music trying to take it the next level on a genre that is still new to most music lovers. It is worth the [money]with all the extra's you get. The forty page book you get and the dvd extras is a pretty cool add-on.,1
Very nice price for something available for $10+ at Home Depot. Not chintzy at all. Will buy more in the future.,1
"This video charges me up for the slopes every season.Not only because of the video footage (which is flat-outamazing), but because of the soundtrack. By FAR thebest soundtrack EVER. It's hard to beat a soundtrackthat features Misfits, Possum Dixon, Primus, Treepeople,Black Eyed Peas, etc.Back to the video part....lust worthy riding in allkinds of situations...featuring legendary riders thatinclude Tex Davenport and Victoria Jeaulouse....this videois lust-worthy.",1
Reading this book was like reading a history book. It seemed as if the people were real life persons who bravely struggled the stem the evils of Hitler's Germany.,1
"This book was easy to read in two days. It is great for anyone going through a difficult time in their life caused by outside and uncontrollable circumstances. It is a transparent account of one woman's spiritual, emotional, legal, and social battle with herself and God, trying to make sense of a devastating tragedy. It's about relinquishing control and trusting God in all circumstances. It's about disapointments in life that can never be changed. It is written from a WASP cultural perspective and it offers tender Biblical encouragement that's realistic. The author is effective.",1
This is a must read! You don't even have to like historical. Excellent story. I have read this so many times my book fell apart and I went to buy hard cover.,1
"This is an outstanding documentary. Not only does it include many informative interviews with people involved in the program, it also features a lot of great footage and photographs from the event. This includes a lot of footage of the actual recovery effort and photographs of the Russian submarine. And it is all tied together with very well-done computer graphics. The story is riveting and engaging and relatively easy to understand. At a time when so many documentaries about technology and historical events are lazy efforts, often filled with inaccuracies, this one is an impressive piece of work.",1
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom and she really liked it. She wanted a little stereo for her room and so far she has had a great time with it. She liked it so much that now she wants to get one for my dad's garage.,1
"I've been a fan of the Closer since season 2. I borrowed a copy from the local library, as the set I purchased was defective. This is another fine season: well done. As Fritz had warned Brenda, Pope is not her friend and it finally comes out in this season. A lot of revelations are revealed as the epsisodes unwind. This is an interesting season overall. If you are a fan of The Closer in particular, or crime shows in general, this is a set to purchase.",1
Very cute way of teaching toddlers without them knowing about it. Cute easy to memorize songs. Perfect for toddlers/preschoolers.,1
This is a great soundtrack if you liked the score to the film or if you are a fan of Giorgio Moroder. This soundtrack also brings back to life the late disco scene of the early 1980s.,1
"This is the first Wodehouse book I read and it will not be my last. The anthology of adventures that Jeeves is involved in are not only funny, they are wildly entertaining. Some of the slang used in the book gives it a distinctly dated English tone, but still very readable nevertheless. The book is a pure escapist fun, frivolous read for everyone!",1
"Everything about this product is great, except we feel the coffee is a bit mild in temperature when served. This morning we tried to warm up the jar by pouring hot tap water prior to brewing, and it worked. Perhaps the jar gets fairly cold overnight, and hot coffee becomes mild unless the jar is pre-heated? Haven't really nailed down the problem, but overall we are very satisfied with the product.",1
"When I bought this upgrade I was still using WINDOWS 98 and XP Home was much better you couldn't even compare it with 98. This is the greatest software Windows has released, ever! This piece is so good and works much faster than 98. If you are in a buisness, I highly reccomend WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL, it is the bst thing for a buisness that works fast. It has everything that XP Home has except like two new features that I can't remember.Was this review helpful?",1
I have completed this study two times and taught it once. This in the best study on how to develop a personal relationship with God that I have ever found. I have always known that I should have this relationship but I didn't know what that meant or how to go about it until this study.My life was changed forever and I highly recommend it for individuals and even more for entire churches. My church did this study together and it changed our church forever.This is a definite must buy for anyone who wants to develop a more personal relationship with God.,1
"...but I don't. I hate to admit this is the first Paradise Lost album I've bought, after reading about them for the last couple years. I'm sure if I'd starting listening to them from the beginning I would be bitching (""Sell outs! Sell outs! "") like the rest of the purists. However, I really enjoyed this album. You should treat it separately from their other albums since it surely is more poppy and electronic sounding. It's very catchy though, and can be described as a techno-like mix of Type O Negative and Moonspell (don't let the techno description scare you off.) Good singing, good varience, great production on this baby. Probably won't stand the test of time like their older albums though.",1
"Sticks by Joan Bauer is a great book! It is my favorite book in the world! It's about Mickey Vernon, a pool player, and how he wants to win the Pool Championship. When a former of Mickey's mom shows up, he offers to give Mickey a few pointers. Mom says no, she doesn't trust him. Then, when she says yes, Mickey is appoluded.",1
I feel that this book is very good because it helps kids with their imigination and I feel that is very important to a childs life. As a teenager I think that it isn't bad. If people don't like this book that don't read it! If you don't want your kids reading these books then tell them to read a different book.,1
"I have been looking for this CD for years. We use to have it in cassette form and somehow lost it. It's a great CD for travelling, expecially in the Mountains.Thank you Amazon.com",1
I love these programs. A strong but flawed woman/human being is juggling her personal life with a successful career and is strong enough to not always play exactly by the rules. My favorite type of person!,1
"An excellent workout. Great for days when I don't have time to do a really long workout, don't want to do any weight lifting and want to keep my heart rate up the whole time (something I don't get with the newer firms).I only wish it was on dvd.",1
"This must be one of the most exciting and powerful performances of Tchaikovsky's Concerto No.1 in recent decades. The phenomenally gifted Turkish pianist, Fazil Say gives incredibly dynamic and vibrant account of Tchaikovsky concerto and Liszt Bm Sonata both. The stature and maturity of his playing is comparable to the Russian masters. His tone ranging from massive and explosive fortissimo to ethereal pianissimo. What impressed me most is the fresh imagination and lyricism he injects into the both works. St.Petersburg PO's playing, under Temirkanov, is equally brilliant and powerful.",1
"Without exaggeration, Virginia Astley has the voice of an angel and the songwriting talent of the Beatles. There was never a more worthy (or more ludicrously overlooked) talent since the advent of ethereal popular music. If you wonder where Enya got her ideas, just listen to Virginia.....she was there first! An absolute visionary....every note of her songs sounds fresh and wonderful; like it could have been produced last week, not twenty years ago. BREATHTAKING AND HEAVENLY IN EVERY RESPECT!",1
I have used St. John's Bay Rum for many years. It is without a doubt the best aftershave ever. My wife loves it because it smells fresh and clean without the overpowering odor you get with other aftershaves. I like it because it refreshes me after every shave and leaves me feeling refreshed and masculine. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any man who wants to break away from those aftershaves you can smell from 100 meters away.,1
"I discovered Rosalia de Souza after first hearing Bebel Gilberto. Although Gilberto is amazing, de Souza is a cut above. I absolutely love her. She is a constant in my rotation. This is her first album and is rightfully her best. Her voice is sweet, soulful, and epitomizes true bossa nova/samba with a spark. The music revolves around consistent drum beats and other catchy percussion rhythms. Her voice play is smooth, effortless, and blends perfectly with the rhythms. I'm not sure what she is saying, but her songs make you feel like your in love on an island paradise. I would highly recommend her.",1
Hitch is the perfect date movie or a movie for a guy who's having low self-esteem when it comes to the dating scene. It's a great flick! There isn't any slow boring parts that linger on and on. Andy Tennant (director) did a wonderful job making this movie. Kevin James is hilarious! I highly recommend it.,1
"This was almost the perfect measuring tape. It's very high quality; everything about it. The only downside to this is not having the measurements on the tape. I recently used a tape that had the 1/8's and such on it and it was so useful. This one doesn't have any of those on it. The magnets are really useful (if you have something metal to attach it to, not really useful for measuring wood I guess.) If they ever came out with this same one with increments written on it, I would buy another.",1
"In my busy life a book has to have a magnetic pull to reel me in and keep me hooked. This novel allowed me the luxury of escaping my own life to live vicariously through these 4 women. Although none of the characters seemed to have had any values nor did I identify with any of them beyond my affinity for the finer things in life, they held my interest. Each one of these women in a different time or place could have been a Jane Eyre or an Emma-women who exploited their looks and charm to get what they wanted. I loved every minute of this novel because these characters did things I only wish I had the brazeness to try. For all those naysayers, learn to live a little. I would rather curl up with this novel and some wine than dine or drink with any of you.",1
"I highly recommend this show. It's a very intriguing, thrilling tale of human survival. It has terrific continuity and the characters and plot develop in very interesting ways. Time Magazine named it one of the six best dramas on TV and Newsday named it ""the best show on TV.""I recommend this show even if you're, like me, not a fan of sci-fi. Battlestar Galactica is very different from other sci-fi shows. There is minimal techno-babble and no lessons in alien culture (in fact there are NO aliens on this show). It is first and foremost a human drama and the writing is very intelligent.",1
"excellent hendrix. just the right amount of soul-close your eyes you can see them in concert. All the best songs plus a couple off the beaten track. turn off the lights, light a bunch of candles-let the purple haze envelop you.",1
"This was my first time I've used hair coloring and I'm very pleased with my experience. The instructions in the package were clear and I was able to follow them without any problems. A friend helped with the application and it worked very well. My hair is naturally brown, so the box said that it should lighten it and give it red tones. The color was fairly close to that on the picture. I'd have liked it to be a bit lighter, so I guess I'll have to get a lighter blonde shade next time. Also, I was warned that my hair may become dry after coloring, so I used lots of conditioner -- even though the box said there was conditioner built in. My hair didn't become dried out at all.",1
"OK, I knew going in that the story line would be off a bit. But even with that, it was still a pretty good movies. Suitable for all ages, almost. I do have to admit that some of the graphics were well done. Think I'd like to have the bracelet. Enjoy!",1
My son's skin sensitivity works great with Pampers. A great brand and a great loyalty to the brand has been our families opinion. We will always recommend Pampers.,1

"God Forbid have crafted probably the most visceral, intense, and technical metal release in years with ""Determination"". Byronde's vocals absolutely shred; he sounds like he's going to pass out any minute from screaming so hard. The guitars are insanely good, displaying an incredible technical sense with riffs that sound like Megadeth on crack, but heavier. The bass player follows the guitars' lead, providing great support and a huge low end. The drums are probably the most impressive; the double-kick work is some of the best I've heard in a long time, and the overall drum sound is just huge. I recommend this cd to EVERY fan of true metal out there, as this tops my list of the best metal cd's of this year.",1
"Ben Freudenburg has established himself as one of the most respected Christian Education directors of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. His glimse into home-based Christian education, as opposed to the conventional church-based Christian education, has changed many individuals views on how the church reaches out through traditional Christian education methods. This book presents a wonderful philosophical basis for beginning the shift to a home-based Christian education system. Check it out.",1
"Gripping; I could not put this book down...I love stories that use different timelines which truly enhance each other, and ultimately converge in a meaningful way. Usually when reading fiction, I feel as though I am a spectator watching the characters as they progress through the story, but with Juniper Tree Burning, I felt much more involved... I wanted to somehow jump into the story myself and hug or scream at the lead character; she is that compelling. She is certainly not always likable, but that is part of why I enjoyed the book so much... it is very different from anything I have ever read. I anxiously await more from Goldberry Long!",1
"As the title for this review suggests, this movie is high on hype. However that makes it far from being a poor cinematic piece. The Spartans have been fabled as some of the best strategic and well trained soldiers in all of Greek history.To bottom-line it, this really brings you into their way of life. They live to die essentially, you will see how brutal Spartans are and how even against enormous odds their life-training is really what helps them fight against a massive force of Persians.Anyways should you get this movie?- If you like to watch dramatized historic events captured on screen. Then Yes.- If you don't like mild to moderate gore. Then no.- If you're expecting something that will just blow you away with superb acting, deep characters and a thick and juicy plot. Look else-where.In short, this is a very energetic revival of the fabled Spartans with a lot of help from 21st century technology.",1
"Cs lewis is without a doubt one of the Greats. i heartily recomend this work, it is a spiritual must.C",1
"The best photographic presentation of petrified wood I have every seen. Frank Daniels' love of the subject can be seen in his work as laid out between the covers of this superb book. I totally enjoy showing non palaeontologically minded people this book when they visit. If a person is looking for a photographic presentation of petrified wood, then this would have to be the book. I heartily recommend it. Congratulations Frank on a terrific book.",1
"The finish on top is ugly. It looks very plasticky, so it may not fit into your environment very well. Overall the price is good for this unit.",1
"Simply said this is probably the best motion picture made to date. At least in my humble opinion. While driving away from the theater, after the first time I saw it, I began to cry uncontrollably. No movie has ever challenged me in this way or brought me to such heights and depths. It should be required viewing for every High School student in the world. Those who pass on this movie because of it's dark side (including my wife) will miss out on a true human story. It will be painful, but in the end it will make you both stronger and enriched. Enough said.",1
"I got mine in the second week of september, had it installed at circuit city. It works awesome with mp3 CDs and the tags are wicked cool. I still get some great sound- even through just the stock speakers in my 97 Honda Accord.This past weekend I was listening to mp3 CDs for about three hours straight for two days in a row. The cds were coming out very hot and started to skip a bit. I ejected them and let it run on the FM stations for a little while, and it worked fine again after I took a break from driving again, but the CD player part of the unit is super bitchy. Aside from that, it's an awesome piece of equipment. I got the two year warranty, so if it does completely melt down I'll be safe, but it's still not 5-star material.",1
I love this parfume and buy it all the time...very nice light scent not over powering or too flowery....I love it and will buy it again and again.,1

"This is a terrific book, very different from the other two written by these authors. It's full of adventure, intrigue and suspense. Addison Black is every woman's dream - secret agent, daring, efficient, strong - and a woman. She's the agent that the British send in when they want to make sure a job will be done. And she works alone. She has her hands full in this book trying to save the Drs. Tidwell, mother and daughter, from agents trying to get control of a new biological weapon. Dr. Skye Tidwell, the daughter, becomes especially important as she is rescued, twice, and becomes Addison's first partner. The fact that Addison isn't sure that any of this is a good idea just adds to the story. This is one you won't be able to put down.",1
"It isn't the text -- that's brilliant. Ms. Holway's editorial material is too distracting. The endnotes are filled with trivia that add nothing to your appreciation of the story; most of the footnotes are gratuitous commentary that you might be able to figure out for yourself from the context. The only academic piece I needed was the background of the courts system, and once that is out of the way, just let us absorb the Victorian aura on our own! I'm just learning to ignore her notes so that I can get on with it as Dickens intended.",1
"On Writing Well is a wonderful book for those who want to improve their writing. William Zinsser holds the view that writing is a craft that one can learn only through constant practice. One of the best things about this book is that Zinsser takes a dry topic and presents it in an entertaining way.The book focuses on improving clarity by eliminating clutter in one's writing. Zinsser lists many of the most-common mistakes in writing; this section made me cringe, but reading it has improved my prose.Zinsser is an opinionated man and that will grate on some readers' nerves. His opinions didn't bother me, except when I thought that he forced them in at the expense of his narrative.I don't want to clutter my review, so I'll end with a recommendation that you read On Writing Well.",1
"Based on a Wall Street Journal expose, this weird film never really explodes, but you do want to watch it because Matt Damon is great as an industrial geek who engineers a scheme to get control of his company by faking a price-fixing scandal and involving the FBI. The lies pile up, and we are never really too sure when reality sets in. It's odd material for a Hollywood movie because there's little action. It's mostly a character study of the lead man, whose quirks and foibles are emphasized by his frequent voice-overs, posed as his passing rapid non-sequitor thoughts. Interesting.",1
"I've read all of James Patterson's books and agree with the other reviews that this isn't one of his best, but still an extremely good read. I finished this book in three days and enjoyed every chapter. It isn't as good as Along Came a Spider but still worth reading.Can't wait for his next book.",1

"Spielberg's awesome vision has finally made it to DVD and it was well worth the wait. Nice nuggets in the ""extras"" category, to be sure. But what's really gratifying, aside from the spectacular picture and sound quality, is that Spielberg chose to restore the film's original ending (without the silly boarding of the mothership). Stunning filmaking throughout.",1
"Works as advertised in my Canon T1i SLR camera for hi-def video capture as well as taking pictures. If you have one of these camera's, this memory is a great low cost option. Works as expected.",1
"If you are long time supporter of the Who Dat Nation, or just a recent fan, this DVD will not disappoint. NFL Films Delivers again!!!!",1
"This album never fails to send shivers up my spine whenever I listen to it. The quality of singing is so exceptional, that it completely overshadows that of other songwriters. The tunes and arrangement blend together to create a haunting ambience around each of the songs. ""Man in the station"" is a wonderful example of this. I would stick my neck out and say that this is the best rock album ever by a solo artist, and I say this after having listened to a lot of Van Morrison, Tim Buckley, Laura Nyro et al. If you are looking for a masterpiece, this CD is what you should get your hands on.",1
"Very good movie, except for the casting of Maxine Bahns in the role as Barry's girlfriend. She is a terrible actress.",1
"At times, this product is a godsend. If your child is fussy and you don't know why, just try it.",1
"I couldn't ask for more, especially for the price. Cleaning a litter box is the worst part of having a cat and this product makes it very painless. I highly recommend this product.",1
"It's humorous and it also shows how hard it is to expand your outlook. The difficulty for someone living in one dimension (point land) trying to conceive of two dimensional life (flatland) and the flatlanders trying to imagine three dimensional life (space land).It was written over one hundred years ago and I have read reviews that say it's politically incorrect, but I don't see it. Anyway, it's worth looking at and the price is right.",1
Mr. Hyde has accomplished something few authors can do for me these days...he wrote a book I couldn't put down. The plot was intriguing and I wasn't able to make an accurate guess as to who the killer was until he actually revealed it. A good page-turner.,1
"I agree with the reviews written, however no one has mentioned how quite the cleaner is or how effortless it is to move around and use. It is lightweight, and rolls like a dream and has a super long power cord. The attachments work well and the pull out extension is fantastic. I couldn't believe the price, nor could I believe how much more dust and dirt it picked AFTER I had both used my old vacuum (commercial grade) and had cleaned the carpets with a commercial cleaner.After I had vacuumed the house with the Dyson I was so grossed by the amount of stuff it picked up,I cleaned the house again. Their are toys and tools, the Dyson is a tool and well worth the the extra dollars you pay. The DC14 is the one to buy.",1
"This is a beautiful piece, and very well manufactured. It has a wonderful shine, and the engraving is very classy. It is a really nice size to either clip to the bike (in a place it won't get whipped about) or fit into a small storage compartment.",1
"This game was awesome, definitely mature themed and I really enjoyed it. I did not have too many glitches with the software (running XP) and this deserves to be reprinted and put on the shelf again. The music soundtrack is awesome too, so good I bought one of the CDs.",1
I can say that this is the best that u can get at a lower price...It is exoensive if u buy at outlets...Reallly cheap....Go for it for any camera's or any battery operated items as it charger both AA and AAA batteries...,1
"This was my favorite product to use, in cream form. It defined my curls without crunchiness and left them soft and supple.",1
"this game is okay. it is not one of my favorites though. in this game you are supposed to keep a log of what a pikachu does in your house. watch tv together to earn money, play games, go shopping, get your fortune, and see an all new episode of pokemon. you can only see it on this game. if you beat the game u can watch it again in spanish. this game is fun but after u beat it, it gets really boring, but you can always start over and play again taking different choices.",1
I've bought several of these books for my uncles who served in the Navy during WWII. They loved it! They told me this was one of the best books on PT Boats out there. I liked it because I don't know a lot about these boats and I found it informative and my uncles know a lot about these boats and found it informative too. One of my uncles especially liked the cut out designs - because he has been making models of several boats and he used this book to help him make a PT.,1
"This is one of the few CD's that gives me chills every time I play it. The intense emotion and vivid atmosphere displayed through voices, atmospheric sounds, and keyboards can take your mind places you've never seen. I started out listening to only rock & metal; but after this CD, everything changed. If you enjoy dark music at all, then buy this CD and lay down with a pair of headphones when you get it. You'll see what I mean.Also recommended: Arvo Pärt - ""Te Deum"" for its similar effects.",1
"Just wanted to say that I love this game, and that is has to be one of the best games out now. The online gaming part of it is even better. You will have to have an internet connection to really experience the game to its fullest in my opinion.",1
"I liked this novel a lot. It was just as good as the movie, and I saw the movie before I read the book, so I already had most of the characters in my head, and I luckily got to vividly see how realistic the dinosaurs were! The only downside is that the veloceraptors kill to many people, and the big tyrannosaurus rex ate NO ONE. But the scene where they had to go on the raft was very interesting and scary none the less. I liked how descriptive Michael Crichton was in writing the book, and how he described the dinosaurs, to make them appear so real to the readers. The movie was totally AWESOME, too. I am a BIG Steven Spielberg fan! Overall, this book was fast-paced and action-packed, a real page turner! Could have gone without so much technical mumbo-jumbo, though. Great work Mr. Crichton, one of your best!",1
"Just like Loeb/Sale's ""Batman: Long Halloween"" and ""Batman: Dark Victory"", ""Batman: Haunted Knight"" is another holiday themed graphic novel. It is a trio of short stories which are nothing short of amazing. In the first story, Scarecrow is prowling about Gotham on Halloween night. The second story is based around the Mad Hatter and his obsession with Lewis Carrol's ""Alice and Wonderland"". Finally, the third story is a batman christmas carrolesque story in which batman learns a life lesson from three spirits who take the form of people who have greatly influenced him throughout his years. ((Note: the final story is clearly meant to be like Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". At the beginning of the graphic novel it says ""Ghosts based on a christmas carol""))The artwork by Sale is amazing and as always, Loeb continues to prove he knows how to tell a great story.",1
"This is a great product and was in the condition described. However, the keys tend to stick. It hasn't caused any problem, but it makes a loud click when I press the keys.",1
"This is an impressing critical overview of the broad specter of theories and methods under the umbrella of cultural studies. The book gives you some sense of direcion as you enter into the sea of confusion made up by the various schools of thought that have influenced todays cultural studies, be it withing media, popular music, folklore or popular studies in general. The book includes a glossary of key concepts, and can be read like a companion to cultural studies. I found a lot of valuable information as the author traced the historic roots of various subjects, enabeling me to change perspective with him as he went along. I am myself a music student, studying within the field of popular music...",1
This is a clear concise book that unveils the lies that abound concerning Catholism. Catholicism and Fundamentalism is a balanced book that brings truth to light against many sensationalist claims.,1
My friend is a big coffee drinker and he loved this coffee. Very flavorfull and smells great when perking.,1
"This is an excellent book for anyone at ANY stage in martial arts. If your a master of the art or someone with an interest in it, you will find Zen in the Martial Arts to be an amazing book. You will certainly find it is well worth ten times its value in the key insights and helpful philosophies within it. I am almost certain you will find yourself re-reading it many times over as I have. Don't wait..get it now! You will not be disappointed.",1
"I loved it. What an interesting family.and they were so involved inso many aspects of the ww 11 era to the present day, from England to Germany to Sppain and the US.",1
this is a great dvd but then I am fan the only critisam I have of this fantastic dvd is the bloody exorbitant price,1
"We had this machine for 4 months, and we are completely in love with it. The espresso is excellent, and the milk steamer outstanding. We use it everyday, suffice to say our coffee consumption went up by a factor of 3. We also particularly like how easy it is to clean (the brewing group comes out easily and can be rinsed in the sink), and the cup warmer (which really warms even heavy ceramic cups).We are very happy with our purchase and hope it will keep working this way for many years.",1
"I got hooked by reading ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", then enjoyed ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" as much if not more if that's possible. If you want to get into this whole great series, it starts with ""The Constant Princess"" but the ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", ""The Boleyn Inheritance"", and ""The Queen's Fool"" are the most compelling.If you want to know about the time that was somewhat skipped before ""The Queen's Fool"" you can read ""- The Last Wife of Henry VIII by Carolly Erickson"" (my rating - 3 stars) and ""Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey"" by Alison Weir (my rating 4 stars) before ""The Queen's Fool"" (my rating 5 stars). I would then skip ""The Virgin's Lover"" only because I consider it a 3 star and perhaps replace it with ""The Life of Elizabeth I by Alison Weir (4.5 stars by Amazon reviewers)",1
"Jessica may be a ditz, but she can sing. I was surprised to discover she wrote 9 of the 11 tracks. I like this CD very much. I purchased this CD after seeing the Sweetest Sin video which piqued my interest at this young girl whom I had heard of, but really had no idea who she was. Then the Newlyweds began, I have been learning way too much about this naive girl. Jessica has much more talent than most of the bubble gum princesses. In addition to Sweetest Sin, the title track In This Skin.",1
I thoroughly enjoyed the dvd !!!! I grew up with the OSMONDS It brought back so many good memories. It is definately worth buying,1
HelloThe GPS has been very helpful even when out running errands. No more getting lost. I am really glad that I purchased this item and wonder why it took me so long. I purchased the home charger which makes the unit more portable because I only carry the GPS unit.ThanksCarolyn,1
"This is a great CD, if you like ""I"" then you will like this one also. I look forward to getting some more Buffalo Daughter.",1
"This review applies to BOTH Science Fiction anthologies I bought at the same time ... all are works from early in SF's history. It consistently amazes me how accurate and forward-seeing the authors seemed to be. The occasional references to ""tubes"" and ""tapes"" can be forgiven, as it would be beyond belief to expect anyone to precisely preconceive transistors and solid-state microcircuits. Both ""SF Hall of Fame, Vol 1"" and ""Masterpieces: 20th Century SF"" are enthusiastically recommended.",1
"the delivery is quick, and it is good.but the book is written a lot inside.so i just give four stars. overall, it is good.",1
"This humidifier is very simple to use, easy to clean, and does a pretty good job. I have it in my daughters room and the quiet humming sound puts her right to sleep! I would certainly reccomend this product. Just make sure to clean out the basin or it will start getting a musty smell.",1
"I actually listened to this book on CD. Sean Hannity does an excellent job of logically explaining the way things are and how they got that way. It is not a liberal-bashing book, but a clearcut exposition of the chasm that divides liberals and conservatives, and why the division exists. This book is for anyone who is interested in preserving America's freedom -- the freedom our Founding Fathers intended for us to fight for with our very lives. Sean is very adept at making his views clear, as well as having a vast array of knowledge on many subjects. Don't pass up this book simply because you are a liberal or an independent -- this book is for Americans.",1
"I bought this book for my birthday and fromthe first page I was hooked. This book is a real page turner, but I recommended for people that have read River God, only because of the characters. I love all Wilbur Smith books. I started reading them last year when I was 15. One of my mum's friends was astonished to find that I had read River God, and the Seventh Scroll, which he only just heard about, and had just started reading river god.Wilbur Smiths books are full of action adventure romance death and much much more. This book is a must for all Wilbur Smith fans, Plus anyone else.",1
"This is my favorite Christmas album along with another one by The Carpenters. I love Martina McBride. She sings so great and she is so beautiful and adorable. She really makes these Christmas songs enjoyable. She's so warm and loving, and I love that about her.",1
"ad that is what it is supposed to be. And it is done in a original way. My kids (2 resp 3) love it. They think it is funny, scary and Halloweenish. Exactly what it is supposed to be. If you are scary and you know it is an absolute favorite and they know the original by heart, and to hear this song with scary creatures just cracks them up. Yes, do not let you children listen to this alone, sing with them and explain the songs, and enjoy and laugh!!",1
"The plot was very interesting though sometimes a little unbelievable. There were a lot of characters and various relationships among them which made it a little difficult to follow. I had to reread portions to refresh my memory on names and what roles they played HOWEVER,those are the negatives. Overall the book very much held my attention. The story was a good one and the main characters were well developed. I certainly would recommend it.",1
"To put it quite briefly, this is a deluxe release of one of the definitive rock 'n roll picture shows, all trimmings included. The bonus features, including commentary and interview footage courtesy of Roger Waters, are welcome additions. I have no complaints; just one question: How does one access the ""secret buttons"" described in the features listed on package? Anyone with any info, please email me at boneyard@smurfs.com. Thanks. Overall: one of the few films that merits a deluxe dvd release. Worth the cash, not just for Pink Floyd fans, but for film and music devotees alike.",1
"This is an excellent CD by Kylie all the songs sound great,it's a great CD with great sound to buy for your collection great for fans of any age.",1
"'Ixnay on the Hombre' is one of those albums with some REALLY good tracks and some REALLY bad ones. For example: ""Gone Away"" has got to be one of the most intense songs I've ever heard; same goes for ""Amazed"" (as well as about 5 others). Then, songs like ""Cool to Hate"" and ""Don't Pick it Up"" throw any intelligent-themes out of whack.MOST of the songs on this album are intense, well-thought out, and musically amazing... there are just a few bad ones to skip through.Go ahead and buy 'Ixnay on the Hombre', there is some hardcore punk-rock on there... just be prepared to skip about half of the tracks.",1
"I read this book ages and ages ago and loved it so much that I looked for it in every public and military library I was near as a traveled around the world for twenty years in the Air Force. It's become so hard to find, that I finally purchased a used copy a couple of years ago. I am a voracious reader, but normally do not read Westerns. However, this is one of the best books I've ever read. It's essentially about friendship, honor, loyalty, etc., but it rises above cliches because the characters are so unique. It (and anything else by Huffaker) needs to be re-published.",1
"I read this book on Memorial Day. Apart from the fact that some of the dialog was a bit cliché the story was very good. I think repeatedly mentioning the vulnerability of three Marines in enemy territory is an excellent way of portraying what must be on the minds of the three. I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to others. Especially, if they are interested in learning about the conditions faced by the men in The Chosin Few.",1
I first heard this album in 1978 and had to listen to it 3 times because my laughter and tears kept me from hearing it all. I wore out my first album playing it for friends and somehow my second one has been has been lost. It is one of the funniest comedy routines I have ever heard and truly stands the test of time.,1
"The product is great. It works well, is clean, not too loud (the water running is louder than the hum of the motor that some talk about but it's relaxing). I've had it set up for weeks. I've let it run with the fountain and unplugged it with just the water sitting in the bowl and my cat has not touched it yet! My cat drinks out of every faucet in the house and begs, literally, for taps to be turned on so he can drink out of them but he stares at this contraption, sniffs, and walks away. He hasn't tried it, not once, even when it's just sitting water. Such a bummer to have spent $70 on the full kit which I thought was a great deal. I keep hoping someday he'll warm up to it. If not, I guess I'll pack it away for future kits.",1
"I love blindside they let me listen to the beat that i like with the christian influence it's great! I love the song Teddy bear my youth group always plays it before wed. night services and everyone gets into it. It's also a great way to win souls lots of teens think that christian music is all HAHLEILUIA stuff but you can buy just about any kind of christian music: ska, rock, praise and worship, gospel, contemperary, alterative, r&b, rap anything you can think of they got it!",1
"i refuse to hide the fact that yes i do like all kinds of music and the eagles are definitely one of those bands from the seventies that are a great band.this,part one of the original greatest hits albums is perfect from start to finish.this is the way 'greatest hits' albums should be,even if it is only 10 songs,at least it doesn't have alternate versions or new tracks,like everyone seems to do nowadays.did i mention how i hate when bands do that? anyway,this is an album of beautiful melodies that should not be forgotten.yes they should have stopped for good when henley said,""when hell freezes over"",nor would i ever see one of their money-making last tour finales. but i refuse to let the great songs that they put down upon wax go to waste.if you've only heard about the eagles and want to check them out do yourself a favor and start here,than pick up the next greatest hits album,vol.2.",1
"If you are looking for a restored visual of the original movie, you will be missing some things. THey have taken out the song, ""The Witch is Dead"". Not sure why it was taken out.",1
"""Barrayar,"" winner of the Hugo award, is itself out of print, but available in the new paperback, ""Cordelia's Honor,"" which also has ""Shards of Honor."" Both together are the story of Cordelia Naismith, a survey officer from civilized, polite Beta. She was first captured by, then married, Lord Aral Vorkosigan, ""The Butcher of Komarr."" ""Barrayer"" is the story of the incredible effect Cordelia had on Vorkosigan's warrior planet Barrayar, and how she stopped the civil war that threatened to slag down the planet. The heir she bore Vorkosigan was twisted and deformed from an assassination attempt during pregnacy. This son, Miles, Lord Vorkosigan, is the hero of the following 9 books (so far) of the Vorkosigan saga. I am very fond of David Drake's and S.M. Stirling realistic SF war stories. Lois McMaster Bujold's ""Barrayar"" and the Vorkosigan Saga stories are Drake's and Stirling's equal. ""Barrayar"" is very highly recommended.",1
"This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it three times. I suggest it to everyone. I've found myself chuckling through descriptions told with humor, but in reality must have been very difficult situations. I've heard only one negative response to the very short chapter devoted to methods of killing and eating animals. It is very shocking. It is not gratuitous violence, it's China's very ancient way. The author did not imply that these methods were widespread by any means. The rest of the book is funny and sad and thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",1
"I would have never in a million years expected a traditional melodic death revival to come from two guys from Virginia, but it has. While influnenced by bands such as At the Gates, they don't rip them off. Arsis is much faster and more aggresive than anything by At the Gates. The vocalist/bass/guitar player sounds a little bit like Tomas Lindberg and the drummer is one of the best and fastest I've ever heard. If Amazon had half star rating this would probably get a 4.5 since there are a few downsides. Obviously, two people aren't going to come up with as diverse of material as 4 or 5 and as a result the songs sound somewhat similar and the production leaves something to be desired. Other than that this is a killer album. Props to Arsis and Insomnium for staying true.",1
"i know a lot of people are going to hate me, but it's true. in the game there is only one gundam wing pilot and that's heero. the other pilots are from different gundam series(0089,gundam z,gundam zz). the game is good but as far as i can tell they could have included more gundam wing pilots. if you are a gundam fanatic buy it,if not at least rent it just for the sake of controlling the wing zero.",1
"This wasn't the best SVJH book I've read, but it was a fun read. ""Wild Child"" is about how blossoming actress Larissa Harris auditions for the school musical, ""West Side Story"", but is not accepted because she doesn't have a C average or higher, which is required to be eligible to be part of the play. She is crushed for a few days and pretty much ignores her drama club friends, Toby and Anna---and when she does talk to them, is not as open and friendly as she had been before. Larissa finally agrees to let Anna tutor her when she finds out that the girl who won the lead role Larissa wanted so badly, Bianca, also had slipping grades and was being tutored. I thought Larissa was being a stuck-up brat because she was so stubborn to accept that she needed help in her schoolwork. Read this if you like, but it isn't on my highly-recommended list.",1
"After waiting for an apparent lifetime backorder from another vendor, I finally ordred this instead and am very happy. Don't bother looking for another ceramic nail file. This is as good as it gets on Amazon.",1
"These are very large bibs, which are good for my almost 3 year old who makes a total mess when he eats still. They seem to clean a lot easier than my previous bibs, and it is great that they can go in the washing machine. My only complaint is that the section for catching food is sewn in the middle so it is a little harder to clean, but overall I am very happy with the purchase.",1
"I love Iced Tea. The recipe for Beach Bourbon Slush is worth the price of the book! We made it one year at the beach and now friends call us ahead of time and say, ""You are bringing the Slush?"". It is a favorite.There are non-alcohol drinks that I love too. The spiced iced tea is now a Thanksgiving tradition.This book makes a great gift too. Even people who never cook, enjoy recipes for drinks. It is pretty, with lots of great photos. The recipes are easy and anyone can make them.",1
"Love the radio....great reception, easy to scan for stations, love the 20 presets. But why on Earth did they include such poorly designed headphones? They feel fine when you first put them on, but after a two hour walk, my ears were aching! I'll have to use different headphones, but I'll keep the radio.",1
"I also agree with the previous reviewer that many people talk alot of s**t about this album without really knowing anything about it's musical value.People negatively review this album because they say they dont understand what the singer is saying or it's just fast metal.First of all,death metal is not about wether you understand the vocals or not.Secondly,there's alot more to this band than playing fast or being heavy.Death metal is a feeling and about creating aggressive and intelligent music.This cd is probably the most technical and melodic of all of cannibal corpse's material.Very aggressive while having alot of catchy riffs and solos.All the songs are great and no filler songs.I have always respected these guys as musicians and they deserve alot more respect than what they are getting from these idiots who are writing one star reviews.GO OUT AND GET THIS!!!",1
"With an ill family member, we tried every glove out there -- we had caregivers in the house who all agreed these are the best glove we bought. The various size options are wonderful. No smell, no residue, best feel, and best fit.",1
"The Fast and the Furious movie that started it all. Once of my favorites. The acting isn't the greatest, but the action is. You have to watch it for the ridiculousness.",1
"These guys just don't quit. And it's a good thing, because there would be a huge void without them. Drawing on influences from the '60's, as ever, but inspiring great new music, they are sounding more fresh and in control than ever. She's Got A Way is a great single, but it doesn't stop there. A must for Smithereens collectors and new to the fold alike. Don't deprive yourselves! Buy this album.",1
"The three phone package works very well for a 2000 square foot home. Signal quality is excellent even when we carry the unit far from the base station. We do not use the answering mailbox system. The menu system seems pretty straightforward and I appreciate the ability to transfer phone books from one unit to another. The speakerphone works satisfactorily, albeit it is not as loud as other speakerphones. I particularly liked the ability to transfer incoming call telephone numbers into the phone book with just a few keystrokes.",1
This item is fantastic. I just hate that I was so late getting into it. The movie draws you in.,1
This was the last great Ted album. Having graduated in '79 in Minnesota it was natural to be a huge Ted fan. It was the peak of the partying years and not too many nights went by without pounding some Ted into my head. Saw him twice live and it still gives me goosebumps when Free For All starts up. It seems like Ted faded with the 80's just like the fun did. This still doesn't have the overall greatness of previous albums but manages some good guitar riffs and decent lyrics.,1
"JLW,is one of that artists that needed much audience of the bluesfans. He's a Bay Area guy,but influenced by Chicago blues,his style mixing R&B,pop,soul... shows a passionate work.The track 5,is simply the best of this cd,'Bad Thing' of Sarah Brown... Really a good job of this fantastic bluesman!",1
"I recently received as a gift the Zoot Suit Riot CD, and I believe it is the best CD/Album I have ever listened too. The musicians are very talented and the compositions are great. Ding Dong Daddie of the D-car line is my favorite this week, running a close second is No Mercy for Swine, and Dr Bones is in third... Thanks for such great music, Daddies...",1
The child care children enjoyed the vibrant colors portrayed on these pages. They talked about the different items that the children had on or were holding. Good conversation starter.,1
"A fascinating dispassionate eye witness first hand review and accounting of Hitler, his closet circle of contemporaries and the inner workings of the Third Reich. A must read if you are interested in this period of history.",1
"I am a General Contractor and we do our own insulating, drywall and trim. I purchased the 50-760 more as a combination air cleaner(1micron bag)and dust colector that we could run continuously while we are working around it. It is a reletively quiet machine, dead silent compared to our large shopvac. It has plenty of power and with the castors it is a dream to move around the houses we work on. I purchased the 50 hose as well so that we could clean the air in smaller rooms without working around the machine and having to keep moving it. It has great suction and the two nozzles move a great deal of air. The only downside is the plastic collection bags are a little difficult to install the first time but it is very nice knowing how much is in them.",1
"the book is another example of Cornelius Ryan's superb research. A good read, too.",1
This stuff is weird and seems like they write it as they go with no real plan in mind. It is fun to watch however.,1
"Normally I would agree with the other reviewers that this map might not be detailed enough for a backcountry trip. However, I just completed the 72 mile High Sierra Trail, and because the trail is so well marked this map would have sufficed. We brought this and reams of other maps I had printed for multiple sections from my TOPO! program and barely even looked at them--we eventually used them for fire starter and just used this map, mostly to identify surrounding peaks and get a rough idea of what was in store for the next day. If you're going cross country and need to do any tricky navigating then I would agree that you need to supplement this with more detailed topo maps, but this gives a great overview and is nicely shaded. It's also very sturdy.",1
"One thing i have to give disney credit for, they are the masters of the motivational, racially charged sports dramas. This movie is every bit as good as remember the titans and basketball fans will enjoy a bit more. The dvd really shines with the special features which show the real life players reminisce about the hatred and the bigotry they experienced while making their journey to the national championship. A movie that anyone can enjoy and respect. Standout performances and very well directed. A must have for your library.",1
"I bought this album not long after it came out in 2000 and I listen to it all the time, its soothing and very melodic. Enyas voice is without a doubt one of the most soothing voices ever! this CD is perfect for sitting down and relaxing too... i used to listen to it when i would go tanning, thats how relaxing this CD is.I recommend it for anyone who likes instrumental melodic hymn like songs.....recommend ""a day without rain, only time, fallen embers, floras secret and the radio played wildchild""",1
"This book is simple to use and understand. No previous experience necessary LOL. Nicely displayed. As an Hypnotherapist I have found it very useful and suprisingly accurate (according to my clients amazement). So much so, clients have ordered the book for themselves. So all in all - helpful and sometimes enlightning",1
These 2 discs....the CD and the DVD-A are incredible. The Beatles never sounded so good. You have never heard their songs sound like this!! It is a must buy if you like their music.,1
"I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer stated. I heard Mahavishnu Orchestra and Return to Forever before Colosseum II. They were both awesome, but it all came together with Electric Savage. This is without a doubt the most fiery display of musicianship ever recorded in the jazz-rock-fusion genre. Gary Moore is the shredder on guitar. He started his career playing the blues, then played with Thin Lizzy before joining Colosseum II, which is a revamped version of the original Colosseum with Jon Hiseman on drums and John Mole on bass. And also on keyboards was the great Don Airey, who along with Gary Moore rip throughout the whole cd. My favorite track is -Put it This Way-. If you love jazz or rock or just great music, you need to get this cd. It is a masterpiece.",1
Excellent historical novel drawing a new and more believable picture of Richard III. Especially enjoyble due to geographical and details. I would reccomend this novel to anyone.,1
"My sister bought one of these straighteners at the mall at one of their kiosks about a year ago. She paid a lot for it, (more than what you have to pay now) but she wasn't using it at the time and let me borrow it. I fell in love with it! It doesn't burn your hair at all, you can control the temp. so it can be really hot for subborn hair like mine, it isn't heavy, it makes your hair look super shiny, and you can turn the ends to make them looked curled and have a ""finished"" look. She saw what type of results I was getting and finally ""stole"" it back. So I had to buy one of my own. The 1 3/8"" is a perfect size so it stays light, and you can get close to your roots, so you don't end up with straighening lines. So I would recommend this to everyone. Spend the extra money and invest in a nice flat iron because you will never have to buy another one...it has lasted for a long time and hasn't lost its quality.",1
I was curious about that myself. The song is Angel Standing By by Jewel and it's on her album Pieces of You.,1
"This is one of my favriote movies of all time. Of all the songs Just Around the Riverbend and Colors of the Wind are my favriote.I definitely give this movie and soundtrack 5 stars, no doubt about it.",1
"This game is so great that my son, begged me to purchase it for a second timethe first time I think it was lost or stolen and that was when it first came out.Although I do not know why some people want to charge more than a hundreddollars for it, when others are selling it for way less. It is a great game.",1
"One of the my more profoundly moving experiences in cinema, both as a viewer and emerging filmmaker. Yang's technical, aesthetic, and narrative precision are models to be emulated, his personal insights on humanity, inspiring and deeply moving.It is a sad, sad day, today -- July 1, 2007 -- to hear of the news that Yang, at 59, passed away. We will no longer be able to witness any more of his art-offerings to the cinematic world ...",1
"I loved this album better than ""Come Away With Me"". Standout songs ""Creepin' In"" with Dolly Parton, ""The Long Way Home"", ""Toes"", ""Humble Me"", ""In The Morning"". Thank you Norah.",1
Great Book. Wonderful price. Superb service. Lost my first copy and have been searching for a replacement that wasn't tied to an e-reader!,1
"I got the TX-1000 to replace an earlier damaged ( I steped on it ) Universal Remote Control MX-800.My surround system is a multi-componet system and my wife is a ""techno-ticked"" person who wants a easy and direct method of controling the ""tv"".This remote ( with the URC provided software ) had the control functions of ALL my individual remotes.ALL buttons can be used in a custom macro. There are even discrete on/off's that were not on the maufacturer's remotes. That makes the macro programming very direct.Just be sure wherever you purchase this from is an authorized Universal Remote Control dealer. If you buy this from a ""third party seller"" URC will not honor the sale and will not provide the programming software.",1
"Have been looking for the song: ""Once Upon a Nickle"" for ages and found it on thisrecording. Very satisfied with my purchase.",1
"Excellent seller; item as described. Even better we got it in time to see the The Tubes in Akron, Ohio and meet the band.",1
"some good somewhat traditional oakenfold but with songs like starry surprise oakenfold is starting to turn moby,decent beats but too mainstream",1
"Derek and the Dominoes was a very short lived group.Derek and the boys lasted less than a year. They released one album and did one tour and it was over.During that time Clapton released what many think is the best album of his career (Layla).This is a record of that tour.Got To Get Better In a Little While is the only complete vesion of the song we have. The version on the Crossroads Box Set is not complete.Key To The Highway is another Gem that appears on this CD.This in my mind along with Crossroads are the two best songs on the collection.Have You Ever Loved A Woman is very strong, and remains one of his songs he does in Concert to this day.Bottle Of Red Wine is another outstanding effort.Little Wing is included along with Let It Rain which is one of his finest songs ever.What we have here is a recording of Clapton at that time.This CD is pretty much for people like me who are collectors.",1
This is one of the most fun SyFy films ever made. The interaction between the Jerry and Darwitch is priceless. And when Jerry is pregnant? A hoot!,1
"I have read many books that highlight the importance of identifying what motivates each employee. Judy and Todd's book actually gives you a tool to identify these individual motivators based on whether the employee is a visionary, adventurer, artisan or idealist or a combination thereof.My business partner and I are both adventurers, go figure that two adventurers would found an Internet startup. Some of the archetypes can be deep rooted. Two years ago, I would have sworn I was more of an idealist - I was on a very straight career path - until I jumped ship. Moving from a non-profit healthcare consulting career to running artimix.com, a startup selling framed contemporary photography, was certainly a jump - an adventurous one at that! One caveat, don't let these categories pigeonhole you, you never know what will happen if you let it...",1
"I recommend this book to any practicing witch who wishes to study the theory behind our faith and its magickal applications. While the authors tendency to jump to historical conclusions on the basis of trivial details or theories that are dubious at best and discredited at worst is worrisome, the remainder of the book is a delight. This book deepened my faith in my belief system and helped me to understand it better.",1
"I am very impressed by this book. It really inspired me to continue with my art and to inspire others to become artists. I really loved the story of Harriet Tubman which not only utilizes some of the ideas presented but would be very useful for teachers to use in their lessons on Harriet Tubman to students. This book can help anyone tap into their artistic, creative side.",1
"This is an excellent album/CD. It is 1970s rock at its best. Lots of background noise but anytime you have a ""live"" recording, that is expected.",1
"I stayed up all night reading this book --not because I wanted to miss sleep, but because I simply couldn't put it down. It's rare to find a book that's so much fun to read and so educational all at once. At the same time you are enjoying the thrill of the story and the author's wild imagination, you are also learning so much-- about cloning, life extention, the science of aging, etc. I highly recommend it.",1
"I bought this book shortly before my mother passed. I had not known that she was soon to die, but I had heard Nancy Poer speak on the subject of deathcare and it fascinated me to consider such a rational and loving approach to death. What I didn't expect was how her description of crossing over and the care those of us on this side of the threshold can give to the dying and dead would help me when I was faced with my own mother's dying process. This book was my sanity-saver during one of the most painful times in my life. I will continue to turn to it throughout my life.We will all die. We will all have loved ones pass on before us. This beautiful and wise book should be on everyone's bookshelf ready to offer comfort and advice.",1
"This was the first Robert Crais work I've read. I picked it by chance without knowing anything about the series or the author. As a detective novel reader, this was one of the best I have ever read. Character and scene development is similar to Joseph Wambaugh but with a good injection of humor. Short chapters and fast moving story with twists make for a ""can't put it down, page turner."" I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.",1
"Everyone interested in Pathworking, should have this book. A classic. I have the printed book, and bought a kindle edition so I can read on my gadgets.",1
"Wayfarers are retro cool. I ended up giving these to my 18yr old to wear to H.S. I had a pair all through h.s. and college, lifeguarding... until I wore them out.Maui Jim offers spring loaded hinges which make their glasses more comfortable, but you can't beat Wayfarers for classic cool.David",1
The work of G.H. Hardy is now and always shall be important to anyone studying mathematics as a career or the sciences where mathematical thought precisely applied is of importance. This text is a must have for those of such a nature. Any quibbling that others may forward is simply jealous ego. Buy and use this book.,1
"As some others have mentioned, most of the information in this book is available for free. However, for the price, having useful, effective information like this in an easy to use format is well worth it.",1
"When looking for films, I want something that will provide entertainment. This film did that. It had a few bits of gore, horror, suspense and was inintentionally funny in a few spots, then, perhaps I just have a warped sense of humour. As with all other films of this genre, it is not for everyone. Some people may want something ""darker"". The ending was unexpected but I won't spoil it for others. I found it a little thought provoking, but it did not give me nightmares.",1
I am collecting the Twilight saga bluray for my wife and I got this for reasonable price. I am waiting for the last part which is part 2. Definitely would recommend for twilight saga fans.,1
Excellent production.If you like oldies (salsa)you should have this c/d.,1
"Istead of dragging out the iron and the board. I just plug in the steamer, hand my article of clothing and start steaming. I LOVE it.",1
This book is one of the best predictable books written. The words are easy for children to read and the book tells a good story. Children want this story read over and over and never get tired of hearing it. All the events in the story lead up to the climax very effectively. I recommend this book to anyone with children.,1
I believe I have a copy of this book. Found it mixed up with some others at a country party store. Found it hard to read. Still I loved it. I have kept it with me since I was a teen. Paid 75 cents for it.,1
"Great account of the evolution of the meteor impact theory of mass extinction. He provides a detailed account of the scientific processes involved in the discovery of the Chixulub crater and its relation to the end of the Cretaceous period. As a scientist in another field, I found it to be very informative for the lay reader (non-paleontologist/geologist, etc.).",1
"These are delightful children's books about dragons, evil princes, and magical powers. The main character is a high-spirited, stubborn young teenage girl. Her life is a bit confusing as she has been gifted in ways that make her quite dangerous (or a great help) to those in power. Through a series of her own mistakes and willfulness and the actions of others around her (many of them negative or trying to use her), she discovers more who she is - and what her place is.The series was fairly fast moving and uplifting; fairly plot and character centred. The characters had delightful and surprising elements to them, and were complicated and real. I don't think it's the kind of book that one would read twice (at least not as an adult) but I'd definitely recommend it.",1
I read a lot of books every year. I don't cry much over books or often. The fact that this one has moved me to tears is by and of itself a commendation to the power of Ms Roberts writing.,1
"In an age of mediocre movies, meaningless special effects and ridiculously exploding cars this movie stands out for having a serious theme, outstanding acting and brilliant plot. In contrast to the well known Chinese bias against females this movie shows the viciousness of such a view and the foundation of what constitutes the real value of a human being. Get it.",1
"If you are looking for a great read, then I would suggest that you read, The Hottest Summer Ever Known by Valencia R. Williams. This novel so is so real and honest that you, like me, may be able to finish this novel in one day.The Hottest Summer Ever Known depicts the story of two sisters, Summer Devyne Lewis and Treasure Lewis. Their story is a story of life, death, love, lust, deceit and the redemption of sisterhood.The author educates as well as entertains her readers about the consequences of living life in the fast lane. The main character, Summer Lewis, ignorantly devises a plan that surely backfires on her. An open and honest depiction of the characters forces all to be cautious and take responsibility for our deceitful motives and actions because after all, what goes around comes around...I applaud Valencia for her efforts to educate her readers about the spread of HIV/AIDS in our community.",1
"This was my first Sandra Hill book. It was so funny and well written that I had to go and order several more of her books. The man is a hotty, their sex scenes hot, the humor is funny. I really love the way this warrior gets hooked on Soaps, especially the Guiding Light. This book is well worth the money.",1
"I got this album in the early 60s and it is still in rotation 'cos I love it.However, the idiots who re-released it didn't really listen to it all the way through. The original vinyl has the Anniversary of WW3 as the last track so when it went silent, you took the record off 'cos it was over. The Anniversary of WW3 is a fine piece of silence and a good joke, but who's going to listen to three minutes of silence every time they play the album? No-one, that's who.When they re-released it with the mandatory ""bonus tracks"", the three minutes of silence are now in the middle of the album - idiots.",1
It works for sure. It apparently tastes good too. It's like melted ice cream. I noticed my 3 month corgi puppy get fatter after 1 week. Reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's pricey.,1
"What exactly is this re-mix? I will tell you. Phil Spector's mix of these recordings was typical Spector: very thick, and heavily produced. Phil's style was never to have the music sound natural. You likely have heard of the typical description of Phil's output: ""The WALL of sound."" This NEW mix takes a completely different approach. This new mix shoots for a completely natural, almost dry sound. The sound of each cut now is close to how a live performance in a small hall would sound. The tracks sound very clean now and one can easily hear each instrument and voice. I can now hear details of the drumming and bass playing that were never clear in Phil's mix. Personally, I am not a big fan of Spector's approach. I often find the wall of sound to be a wall of mud. I like Paul's new mix because it sounds so clean, natural and UN-produced.",1
"A perfect album to start off a Weird Al Yankovic collection with. Some of his best early stuff is included here like Eat it, Fat, and Dare to be Stupid are some of the funniest songs I've heard in a long time. However, Addicted to Spuds, One More Minute and I lost on Jeopardy are great too. All in all it's a solid album that would put anybody in a great mood!",1
"This is one of the few books I remember my elementary school librarian reading to us during my childhood. I loved the story of the multi colored caps balancing on the peddler's head as he walked through town yelling ""caps for sale!"" Then to find that as he napped, his caps disappeared. Looking around for them post-nap, he discovers a band of monkeys in the tree wearing them. He tries to get the caps back but each time he yells at the monkeys, they just ape his actions. Finally they throw the caps down and he continues on his way selling his multi-colored caps. I highly recommend this book for all children. My daughter is 2, almost 3, and she also LOVES this story. She finds the monkeys funny - especially how I imitate their actions.",1
"This film not just has an amazing plot but wonderful graphics as well... If you have a blue ray player, i would definitely recommend buying it in BR. I love all anime movies and this one has to be one of my top favorites. It has action, romance, sorrow, and etc. It's everything you would ever want in a anime film.",1
"Ivana Santilli's 'Brown' is a definitely worth buying - especially if you're a fan of her previous work as a member of 'Bass is Base'. She has an amazing voice. It is not a genre of music that appeals to the masses. If I had to describe her genre of music, I would say that it's a combo of Jamiroquai and Mariah Carey... and she's prettier than Mariah!",1
This is my 3rd Bunn. This classic coffee maker is the best. I have to replace it about every 10 yrs. So I think this is a product you can trust. My family are coffee drinkers and is going all the time. Well worth the money.,1
"I started my first day at school with the author. This book made me cry--it made me laugh. There is such a learning experience in it all. I am glad to have been a part of this story. My name is in there too! Needless to say, I love this book! I gave one to all of my sisters and nieces for Christmas! After all these years we're still best buds!",1
"we have an older model and overall we have been happy with it. it is certainly enough to heat a small bedroom. it turns itself on and off reliably. we have several other space heaters (different sizes and brands), but the best feature of this space heater is the child-safe controls.our toddler was fascinated with the heater we had in his bedroom and would always turn the thermostat up to HIGH-80 - despite our repeatedly telling him not to touch it. we finally found this heater, which he can't turn up or on. you have to push the dial down AND turn it in order to turn it on, or to change the setting from low to medium or high (something a very young child will have a lot of trouble doing). along with the other safety features, that makes this model the best for keeping in a toddler or preschooler's room.",1
"It is so good for you. Filling. & it tastes like candy. I could, & probably have eaten them all day.",1
"i love this toy sooooooo much!the giant bat dudes are my favorite of all the monsters!! they are very cool and they come in twos in the packages. they do not break easily. i even hung the bats up from the ceiling with fishing wire and made kong ""battle"" them.",1
"This is quite a humorous movie - not to be taken seriously, of course. It made an excellent addition to my movie collection.However, I would say that I don't really understand or much like the ""BD Live"" component (for ""bonus content"" it says on the back of the case): it kept telling me that it was trying to and failing to connect to the internet before it would play the movie and it bothered me. Not a big deal, but a nuisance.",1
versatile booster..moderately priced..like that it adjusts so that you can adjust the adult seat back when child falls asleep and the booster moves with it to enable child to sleep without head flopping around. Just a base seat booster would do that as well but without the extra side head support for the child.,1
I like that it is a very factual account but at times I got lost in the detail. All credit to the author for his research.,1
I love the movie. All the Twilight movies are the best. It keeps me on my toes wondering what will happen.,1
"GREAT FAN. SUITS MY PURPOSE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH BUTTON, THAT YOU NEED THE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET AVAILABLE AS A REFERENCE.",1
"This out-of-print study is a vivid description of the sources of the world before the great pyramid age, analogous to the period of Archaic Greece before the Classical. The small beginnings are as significant as the flowerings. Hoffman makes clear the rapid acceleration in development that took place in the so-called Gerzean age, ca. 3300 to 3000 BC. A charming book for students of ancient history.",1
Great little washclothes. Use them actually in the kitchen. Since I change them daily I need lots and these four were a great price.,1
"I ordered 3 pump bottles (cause i cant find lava anywhere) and they sent me the bars of soap. I was a little annoyed so i called them. They apologized, sent me the bottles and let me keep the bars. No extra cost. Nice! thats why they get a 5 star..",1
"I found subject matter of the book to be quite good. However the lack of commas in appropriate places, and occasions of ""loose"" instead of ""lose"", for example, sort of broke the immersion in the book for me throughout. There are enough instances of poor grammar and punctuation that I would suspect this is a self-published book, rather than a professionally published piece, but the author is entertaining and inspiring, and well worth a read.",1
"This cd is jawdropping. Literally. North Carolina never had a music scene until jamie king (swifts drummer). This cd is amazing. Metal as hell, soft as a baby's bottom...this cd doesnt dissapoint. Buy this cd or kick your own ass.",1
"Robert Munsch outdid himself with this tale of a mothers love for her child. I came across this book myself when I was a teenage babysitter. Now, as an adult and a mother to four beautiful adopted children, my family has come to treasure the story of a child going through the stages of life and a mother who loves him unconditionally. If you hear anything negative about this book, I encourage you to get a copy and see for yourself. I would almost guarantee that you will become entranced and near tears when you read the words ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as you're living, my baby you'll be."" In a small book, we learn the lengths that a mother goes to and what she endures for her children...and that no matter what..and above all else, she loves them just the same.",1
I got this for my brother and his wife when they were expecting my nephew. It is absolutely adorable. I noticed they had it at the hospital with them when the baby was born and had his footprints stamped into it. This is a must-have baby book for any Winnie the Pooh fan who is expecting. There are places to record all the important events from birth to five years.,1
"No frills or fancy workings, just plain old Johnny Cash reading the New King James version of the New Testament. It's straight-forward and understandable, delivered in a matter-of-fact tone that leaves interpretation open to your own mind. Johnny Cash does his best to read without flair and dramatics, allowing the words to speak for themselves.I enjoy unwinding after a long day by throwing on some headphones and relaxing to the soothing words of JC.",1
"This was a gift for my grandson, who is learning a lot and so is his Mom!It is very unique. Some of the plants, I had never heard of. A realcollector's item.",1
"A moody, atmospheric re-rendering of the vampire story. Catherine Deneuve is... well, she's Catherine Deneuve: elegant, beautiful, with a timeless/ageless quality this movie makes the most of. David Bowie co-stars in one of his best film performances. Wonderful photography and sound track lend to the atmosphere. A must-see for anyone captivated by the vampire mythos.",1
"I love it when a writer creates a whole new world. This has been one of my favorite books forever, and just had the opportunity to read it again. The crystal based lifeforms, and they way our hero navigates a planet after his armor-plated robot come bodyguard is destroyed is fantastic. Wish there was more like it.",1
Good calculator for price. It does the job as needed.I would recommend this for an all around the house calculator.,1
"I wanted a beginning book on Access, which still went into Power User mode at some point. This book fills the bill. The author uses three complete applications -- a college advisor's database, a music booking agent's application, and a (simple) wedding guest database. Through these three applications, with very nice lookup tables, connected queries, and involved reports, the author shows how to do it. First with the Wizards, then directly in Access. I found this book an excellent introduction to Access, showing where all the features are hiding and how best to use them. The only warts are that the directions are not always clear what screen you should be on, or how you got there. It can be figured out, but does take a bit of time investement. The time invested is well rewarded, however, in terms of your comfort with what you can do with Access.",1
"This is the best and most comprehensive book I read or reviewed about MS OLAP and data warehousing. It has it all. It discusses MDX, DTS, Multidimensional data modling, data warehouse design, maintenance, and even a brief discussion of decision support objects in an appendix. The only thing I think it lacks is a discussion of ADO-MD and examples of how it can be used to access OLAP data from client apps. I hope the next edition will cover these topics along with the new topics in SQL 2000 OLAP Services. If you are out looking for a good book on MS OLAP, you found your wish with this book.",1
"Clif Bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars I have ever tried. They may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands, but there have been times where I could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture.",1
"If you have read my other UB40 album reviews then you know I come at this as an interested fan that has only really recently discovered the depth of this band. So my review may be more relevant to you if you are a fellow neophyte to UB40. This is good stuff. You should have it - especially if you have bought others and your appetite is still not sated. You will like this album. This album represents what I and you - the new, happenstance UB40 fan are looking for. Solid start to finish like Present Arms. The tracks that you'll keep going back to once the rythms get in your head after the first listening: ""As Always You Were Wrong Again"", ""If It Happens Again"", ""You're Not An Army"" and ""Seasons"".",1
"This was one of many free books I have read on kindle for iPad. I decided to post a review because I liked it enough to immediately purchase the 2 sequels. Maybe this is why we get free samples! I liked the female friends at the heart of the trilogy and wanted to see how they found their ""happily ever after""s.",1
I always had problems getting to grips with the math behind computer music. This the first book I found which talks you through comprehensibly. There are loads of diagrams and helpful examples. Hasn't made it to the shelf since I bought it!,1
"I'm generally not a fan of ear bud earphones because I don't like sticking things in my ears, but these were a pleasant surprise. I bought them to use with my Nintendo DS. The soft cushion makes it feel like they're barely there and the sound quality is great. Highly recommended.",1
Don't get me wrong this album is really good. But the singer sound kinda flat on the CD. If you hear the performace they did at Manchester they sound WAY better.,1
"This play is the usual extreme histrionics that I have come to expect from Tennessee Williams. In this book set on a Southern Plantation we have the obligatory hysterical woman, an alcoholic and a homophobe. After a while one cannot help but get the impression that Mr. William's works all consisted of the same stock, cardboard characters and he only changed the settings and their names.I do give this book 5 stars because I have always liked Elizabeth Taylor who starred in the movie of this play although she is in fact a Real Life Serial Monogamist as the Sociologist would refer to her .",1
"This depicts how racing careers started years ago, and Jeff Bridges does an awesome job of showing a great motorsports movie.",1
"Great video coverage and documentary , well made and beyond interesting . cant waite to take some photos of my own",1
This Alaska DVD really does a great job of providing a glimpse of Alaska for all to see and behold. There is great footage featuring the wildlife such as the bears and whales. The beautiful music also gave it a nice touch.,1
"Check before you buy: this book has been printed in 3 different editions. I am writing this review for the one I prefer which has dimensions of 16.6 x 13.5 inches. This is important because it is huge and for a book of nude photos of Pam Anderson this is the way to go. That said, it's also the most expensive version but the printing is incredible and well worth it. The other two versions have dimensions listed at 12.1 x 11.9 inches and 14.2 x 11 inches. Between the three the super-sized version is the way to go in terms of quality.",1
I knew this would be a great read. I was inspired after watching the movie. Such an amazing story teller. You feel like he is talking right to you.,1
My 6 year old loved it. My husband and I really enjoyed the movie as well. This is by far my favorite of the Madagascar movies.,1
I had the pleasure of playing on a Fox Renard oboe for several years. It had a lovely sound and was a pleasure to play. I'd pick up one and play again in a heartbeat!,1
"This movie is great to watch if you are feeling down. You start to laugh right away with all the comments and the situation. The actors are great, each one do a great job with their roll. I raelly recommend it!*Sponsored Post",1
"I never read a book like this before. What a wonderful plot with so many interesting characters. The awareness of love, betrayal, devotion and honesty is so accurately depicted in this book. I'd recommend it anytime.",1
"I bought this one for my DH. He has been really happy with it, but I should say this is not a commercial food grinder that you will be able to grind up 90 lbs of meat at a time without any babying. The first time we used it, we learned quickly that any of the white connective tissue will clog the grinding plates. For our home use, making a little bit of ground meat here and there, this works great. We bought it with the sausage stuffer attachment and made some great deer sausages.",1
"Our 2 yr. old granddaughter has enjoyed the sticker fun over and over again! And you really can use the stickers many times before they lose their ""stickiness.""",1
"My husband loved it. We first say this show on TV many years ago in black and white. For me it was quite bloody, but my husband enjoyed it.",1
"Got this after our Abo Instent tent broke (was too hot for the beach anyway). This tent stays cool, is light, inexpensive and just the right size for infants/toddlers. Baby enjoys seeing us through mesh screen. Could use stake hold downs to keep fabric sides from blowing in wind. For the money, this is it.",1
"This radio is great. It's small and doesn't distract you and the type size is big enough to read at a glance. The backlight option for night driving is great also. It's easy to move from car to car and the small antennae was simple to install and never moves from it's spot. The only problem I have is that from time to time my antennae wire comes loose and I have to turn it a bit to get reception, but I suspect that's more a faulty wire than the radio itself. I highly recommend the Roady2 and XM radio in general.",1
This work is an outstanding example of the scolarship of the classical Hebrew language. The work covers nearly everything on this matter. The print is sometimes too small and the structure of the book is a bit complicated. I recommend it for a person who wants to dig into the language.,1
"I recommend this series because its very interesting, it has everything love, friendship the importance of family. There is also lots of drama. Trust me if you buy this you'll never get bored not even once. This Program is very entertainning you will want to see it to the end.",1
This is a well built shovel that will last years and years. The price is unbelievable.Why spend $40-$60 for something of equal quality???Get one you won't be sorry.,1
"Overall, a decent collection of songs from an excellent band. While it's quite mediocre compared to ""Change Is A Sound"" and ""Exit English,"" it still was very good. ""Notes On Pulling The Sky Down"" is absolutely superb.",1
"good album, good songs, much like the first one but as good/better? i liked this one probably slightly more than the last album.key tracks: eleanor put your boots on, this boy, youre the reason im leavin, walk away... the list goes on, all are fun.i actually like the slower tracks on this album whereas i liked the faster ones on the last album... o wellz guess thats just me.",1
"An overview of the works and life of Picasso, as innovative as the man himself. Interesting techniques revealing the master's own techniques.",1
"This all star team suceeds in every respect, a truly great sonic work. lifted immediately into the futuristic world of deltron 3030, amazing black humour and sci fi imagery wind through everything del utters on every track. its impossible to praise enough. the automator reaches his current peak hear and every sound and nuance lifts the deltron world further into the stratosphere. expected greater things from the gorrilaz based on this collaboration, but this outshines by a long way.truly excellent.",1
Wonderful compilation. Artists and selections are great as is the quality of the sound. I cannot stop listening to it.,1
"So much has already been said, it's hard to know what to add. Everyone's personal experience with a book is different. Our opinions can be shaped by so many different factors. For me, this book was an escape when I desperately needed one. No long sob story is needed: I spent my summer traveling back and forth to the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. I have something called a brain AVM, and we had to figure out what to do about it. I had lots of tests, some of them...uncomfortable. Whenever I could read A Breath of Snow and Ashes, I escaped from all the stress and worry. Words cannot express how much I enjoyed this book, and how much I cherish this series.",1
"I guess you're all right (refering to all of you who wrote reviews), it is pretty impossible to cram the so called ""Best Of"" into one thin cd. I, too, would recommend the full albums. However, if you've never listened to Velvet Underground before, or you want some but not all, then I guess this is the cd for you....",1
"The Rand McNally Calgary Easyfinder provides a great quick reference for navigation for the deliberate tourist who has some idea of where he or she needs to go in the city of Calgary. This particular version offers a large scale map on one side of the entire Calgary metropolitan area, while the reverse side provides a more detailed look at the center of the city, oriented on the Bow River as it flows west to east.

"This movie is a very ""Stephen King"" kind of a movie. Several people who are faced with a unique scenario. In this case, several wardens, who receive into their care a huge prisoner, a gentle giant who happens to have strange and unique powers. The movie is very long - more than 3 hours, but no scene should've been removed, every part has a small meaning which contributes to the larger whole. The casting is superb. The acting is great. The special effects were done with taste. It simply works! Wonderful movie. Go and watch it if you haven't already.",1
"I was first introduced in RoLW a while back, from the OVA which aired a few times. I was able to get ahold of the DVs, and most recently wondered if I could find the original comics. I bought not ontl this one, bu the entire repring of the Grey Witch Series. I started to get worried because nowhere in the Review did it say if these books were in English! But they were! Things happen a bit differently in the comics, which is always nice to see what was changed for the movie, to compare and contrast.The only thing that prevents this from being a 5 is th lack of color, but I'm not complaining about anything else",1
"I bought this flash for myPanasonic Lumix DMC-FZ30and it's a great little flash. You have extensive control over the amount of flash that it provides. You can ramp up for a large room or tone it down for a closer shot.It can swivel both vertically and horizontally. Bouncing the flash off the ceiling gives you a more natural fill, without the hard shadows and ""red eye"" effects. You need the horizontally swivel if you want to rotate your camera to the portrait orientation and want to bounce the flash off the ceiling.It takes 4 AA batteries and I get about 80 shots from a set of rechargables. I use theSanyo Eneloop NiMH batteries, which comes as an 8 pack. That way I always have a set ready to go, while the other 4 are charging.I would recommend getting theSto-Fen Omni-Bounce for the Sunpak 383, it does a great job of diffusing the flash when you have to aim the flash head on. You'll get a much nicer picture when the light has been diffused a bit.",1
"Sam Levine has a great feel for the sax and his playing is the perfect setting for these songs. I really enjoy his ability to reinterpret the melody without losing the original and his restraint on the constant ""fluttering"" that other sax players overutilize. Great CD, great songs. Buy this one.",1

"This album was a true classic. Zeppelin took the the simple hardblues metal of the Stones and added more musicianship. The Stonesand the Kinks,The Who and the Yardbirds were a large influenceon this album. Cream also shows in the music. Zeppelin was notthe first Heavy metal band, but they set the goal for classicmetal and flew over it time and again.",1

"The only other Danielle Steel book I've read was Sunset In St. Tropez, which I didn't fully enjoy. But this book...I loved. It was very touching and even if you've never dealt with a loss, you still felt like you could relate with the characters. I didn't give it a 5 because I'm very picky about my books.",1
"First off, let it be known that,I realy dislike critics. This album just happens to be one of Jethro Tulls best albums as far as I am concerned. I have owned it as an album (still do), 8 Track, Cassette, also cd. My music collection would not be complete without it.",1
"I do not know whether I will be able to read the pieces in On Grief and Reason. I had read the title essay, which says that Frost is rough and goes through his ""Home Burial,"" in the New Yorker, I think, and saved it, and it had deteriorated. I bought the book for the essay. It is that important, Brodsky is that important. It is the best single reading of a Frost poem that I have ever seen, but good-better-bests is not the issue. It is full of assumptions that everyone should have about what poetry is. It is how to read poetry. Stuart Filler",1
"I've wanted to read this book for a while now, mainly to say I've read a Charles Dickens book and this one looked short. I did enjoy the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, it is a very famous and well known story, so i didn't really have to focus on what was happening and instead I focused on the beauty of the writing. I see why Dickens was so famous and I will be reading some more of his work in the future.",1

If you are looking for a good thriiler, this book is #1. I think the authour did an astounding job writing and summarizing the game and I am looking forward to buying another book of this seiries.",1
"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.",1

"From some of the reviews below it would appear that pop music has become a dirty word - or two! The Killers may not have the sense of importance of Interpol (who actually steal quite liberally from Joy Division), and sure, they appear to be complete musical kleptomaniacs but in a sense it does not matter if the ideas are put together to create a new whole. So whilst the band wears its influences on it's collective sleeve there is no denying the rush of sheer, grin causing pleasure I experienced on hearing ""Mr. Brightside"" or ""Jenny"". The band does seem to run out of ideas by the end of the album though which is a shame. At least 5 of the tracks however are near perfect pop music, in all it's cheap, disposable glory, and although this album may not stay on your player for years to come I've found it to be the perfect summer companion.",1
"This particular purchase was deliberately made of the older version. For those who want to have less of the current Prayer Book and its continuing evolution and more of the the rich history of the book itself, this would be the selected text.",1
"The book, as advertised presents an overview of the practice of Kendo; however, the best portion of the guide is the pictorials of various strike and defense practice, along with written instruction.For a new practitioner, like myself, Kendo: The Definitive Guide was well worth the purchase.",1
"I always used Johnson's Baby Lotion but was never a big fan of the strong scent. I was recommended the Bedtime Lotion by a friend who is a beauty consultant at a local department store and I don't know how I got along without it! I can use it at night before bed and when I wake up my skin is baby soft without a strong smell. I can use my regular lotions, body sprays, or perfumes the next day for work without having a lasting scent from using the lotion the night before! I highly recommend this lotion along with the 24 Hour Moisturizing Johnson's Lotion!",1
"This woman has it ALL. She is incredible and nothing she does ceases to amaze me. Her voice gives me chills, so pure and honest and shimmering. Truly the most gifted actress/singer I have ever heard or seen. I could play this CD over and over and be content. So many great selections. Some of my favorite are ""Ain't it the truth?"" ""Bambalele"" ""Beat my dog"" ""See what I wanna see"" and ""I double dare you."" I urge you to buy and listen to every one of Audra's recordings because a talent like this is RARE! I feel like I know her just from following her career and countlessly playing her recordings. She has inspired me as a singer more than anything else has. She is AMAZING!",1
"Gilbert Morris has taken an interesting turn in this series by taking several of his characters to Africa as missionaries. I found the plot interesting and the characters realistic enough to even be mad at them when they were hard headed. It had new experiences and was well done. I recommend starting somewhere earlier in the series, but this is one of those books that you can pick up without reading the prequels and still get stuff out of it. Well done again Mr. Morris!",1
"The talent and skill of John Rusnak is what every piano student should strive to attain. John Rusnak is a musician with technical skills, a great depth of musicality, and a passion for the classical. He is genius; he is true to the composed work, all the while losing himself within it. It is a blessing to hear him. This is a great album within a really great album cover! :) A perfect gift for anyone who has a love for piano performance, classical music, Chopin, perfection, or passion...!",1
"The beautiful voice we expect. Renee gets credit for writing some of these songs.Many songs are named ""Hold Me Now,"" but her's is special. I think it's the gem of the collection. I like the dream/fantasy feel of ""Stars Fell on Alabama,"" and ""Midnight in Austin Texas"" is just plain fun.This CD is mostly romance, and won't let her come through with the power we know her voice has, but it shows variety in her talent.",1

"This is awesome offer I was able to get. Ordered 2 year Subscription of Seventeen magazine for my oldest daughter in august during amazon's $5 subscription promotion. Ordered this in August and got her first issue this month (September) already. That was fast. Even if your not able to get it for $5 it still a wonderful deal to get it on amazon, I have never gotten a magazine this fast. when I ordered it from another way it has always taken at least 2 months to get my first issue.Thanks AmazonSeventeen, September 2008 Issue",1
"First of all, let me say I don't generally like sequals, but I really enjoy Pratchett. He is very witty, thought-provoking, and his writing has gone from excellent to the-best-fantasy-of-our-time in the past years. I love his characters. I love his plots. I love the way the discworld makes you stop and think and laugh out loud. I have to read some of his books three times before I understand all of his literary allusions and humor. The ONLY flaw I can point out in this book is that it is a sequal and that puts it at a disadvantage to his original books. (ie Guards! Guards!, Small Gods, Pyramids etc) Still, an excellent book. I only wish we could get his books sooner in the US",1
We watched it last night on the WB. My daughter can't stop talking about the show. She has the Samantha doll and we have read all the books. It's what TV should be for our children. We are now buying it on DVD. Thank you AG for doing a great job.,1
This is one of the best things invented for women who wants to get pregnant. It is extremely accurate in predicting your fertile days. Don't waste time anymore using ovulation sticks. This is the best investment. No more wasting time playing the guessing game. Highly recommended.,1
"The smooth sound of Henry Mancini is sweetly rendered on this impressive disc. Mancini has the knack to play easy listening music with an edge. You hear electric guitars, vibes and other arrangements that keep his music distinct from other wannabees. Andre Previn's ""Like Young,"" Mancini's own ""Cool Shade of Blue,"" and ""That's All"" by Bob Haymes are magic. The one letdown is that this CD clocks in at only 34 minutes.",1

"First off, I must say that I have a bias against live recordings. In my personal opinion, they rarely, if ever live up the original studio recordings. That said, I still love this compilation of Meat Loafs hits. It has every song from Bat Out of Hell, all the best from Bat Out of Hell II and a few others from assorted other albums. These live versions are very well done for the most part. If you've ever seen Meat Loaf in concert, you know that he puts his all into each and every song. It definately shows on this album.",1
"Your personal trainer is very complete and easy to apply. You can create your own fitness program choosing from many different sports and exercises. It has a time and distance program for runners, even to prepare you for a marathon. I liked it because so many books don't make it easy to make your own program. They don't organize it in a good way. This book is easy to use, very complete and I spent a half hour trying to locate it on this site. That is how good the book is. I could only remember the author's name Goodsell but it wouldn't come up in the search so I guessed and tried Goodall and I got it. Well, try it you will like it.",1
"life experiences to back up their claims. For example on individual who reviewed the work above claimed the book is false. The same individual misses the point regarding the book. For example:""And spend in the way of Allah and cast not yourselves to perdition with your own hands and do good (to others). Surely Allah loves the doers of good."" (2:195).Allah shows love based on good works. Islam is based on good works in order to receive the entrance to heaven and God's mercy. In Christianity Love is unconditional. The Caner brothers go to special lengths to specify the differences in their book and this is one MAJOR element. Apparently the prior reviewer was so one-sided in his view and beliefs or Islamic faith that he failed to see the hole picture.I recommend this book highly to anyone wanting a quick overview of Islamic faith and how it relates to Christianity.",1
"These handy hanging hooks are very convenient to use, require no skills to ""install"" and can handle a reasonable amount of weight without worry of a middle-of-the-night crash. I probably would not try to hang a sledge hammer from one but they have certainly been handy for small hand tools and kitchen utensils. No issues at all even in a very dry, high altitude environment.",1
"I bought the Coleman battery lantern before we went on a camping trip with my 6 year old daughter and her Y-Princess tribe. I liked the idea of a battery-powered lantern, as opposed to a propane or liquid fuel lantern, around little kids.It turns out that the Coleman battery lantern is the best lantern I've ever used. Most importantly, it throws a ton of bright white light - this is ""hang the lantern on a tree branch and have enough light to pitch the tent, build the fire, cook dinner, etc"" kind of light. In addition, the Coleman battery lantern lasts a lot longer than I expected on a set of batteries, turns right on, is easy to find in the dark (when you leave the night light feature on), is easy to carry... I could go on and on.Sure, 8 D cell batteries are expensive, but that's the only down side I can see. The benefits mentioned above, plus the huge benefit of safety around the kids, more than makes up for the additional expense, at least in my book.",1
"I love this binder, the material that I wanted it for fit in perfectly. I am thinking of getting another one",1
what i like the most about this game is the very cool stealth moves that have never been seen before in all the other splintercell games. the graphics are very good too but half the time you cant see the best of them because your in the dark. overall chaos theory is a very good game that is way better than what you pay for it.,1
I use this with flushable litter so when I need to all I have to do is roll and dump the containers contents into the toilet. Save lots of time and really helps out with the gross factor.,1
"Got this for my granddaughter last year for her 3rd birthday and she still loves it! She tends to play ""chase"" with it more than actually jumping over the arm as it spins around. I didn't know anything about it before I bought it had never seen or heard of it before, however it was her favorite toy by far (she has a December birthday, and got totally spoiled between her party and christmas, so this toy had a lot of competition!) I would highly recommend it to any preschooler!",1
"This book is an amazing book, and it's filled with lots of good infomation on the class that it's based after along with the movie that has the same name. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for good insight.",1

"Yes, some of these moves are now outdated, since the video was done in '95, however, they are still fun to do instead of running or some other horrendously boring form of exercise. I found it to be fun, easy to follow (not sure how easy it is for those who don't dance well already), and the music was great! Very energizing!",1

"Kent Haruf's books Plainsong and Evensong are compelling, beautifully written book whose characters are vividly and concisely developed. It is a book about small town life and the very real people who live in those towns (at least a few of them). I hope he keeps on writing.",1
"My daughter actually told me about this book - they had read it at pre-school, and she mentioned it often enough for me to purchase it. It's a very cute story about separation anxiety, and I think it actually gives children something to hold on to when they are nervous or scared. My daughter often gives her hand to me when saying goodnight, so that I can kiss her palm, and she says ""Mommy loves me!"".",1
"Amazon needs to indicate that this comes in a cheap click case and not a hard case as this matters to some of us choosing to buy this edition of the movie. Should be listed in the ""details"" of the product.A Blake Edward's classic...fun,fun,fun! Great cast. 5 stars for the movie..rated the presentation 5 stars because of the case.",1
"Sarah McLachlan's voice is one in a million. It can bring tears to the strongest of eyes. Live CDs usually get on my nerves,but this just too great of a collection worry about things like audience noise. Mirrorball contains such beauties as ""Angel."" This is definately one of the most emotional songs ever written. ""I Will Remember You"" is a tear-jerker if ever there is one. You absolutely can not go wrong with a treasure like Mirrorball.",1
"I Have read this book and I think that it is a great book for teenagers. It is well written, it describes Holden Caulfield's life in great detail, and it is extremely funny. It is written to show the slang that Holden uses in his writing, but does not make you think that the author too is using slang. Highly recommended!",1
The language was difficult to get through at some points and there were a few times when the plot slowed down to a crawl but overall I found reading this book to be very enjoyable.,1
"Not the most exciting game, but my son likes it & I put stickers on a chart to mark each word he makes correctly.",1
"What I like about this album and any other smooth jazz album is that it takes you to a place beyond this world. It enhances your imagination, and creates a sense of beauty and enlightment.""After the storm"" by Normnan Brown gives you a peace of that imagination. Just about every track on this album is soulful. My favorite is the track ""Lets come together"". This album is just a peace of Norman Brown work. He takes music from that time and remixes it with smooth jazz concepts, giving the listener a whole new appreciation. I highly reconmend you purchase this album.",1
"This is a fabulous book. My mom has had an earlier version for years, so I finally got my own.This book tells to how you can naturally cure any ailment from dandruff to ADHD, all naturally.I think that everyone should have this book around as a reference guide, especially if you have kids.",1
"This book attempts to introduce the reader to a very broad spectrum of British ships and smaller craft, ranging from great ocean liners and warships to fishing and recreational boats. Using a very good array of photographs, both black and white as well as colour, this book does provide a good overall historical chronology of the development of British shipping and boating, and includes profiles of several selected ship and craft from the liner SS Southern Cross to Motor Torpedo Boats, the Norfolk Wherry, and ""Golden Hind"" class sailboats. All in all, a good coffee table book for light reading, but the serious maritime enthusiast or researcher might be a little disappointed.",1
I have read the past few reviews given for these bottles and I wonder if we are talking about the same bottles. I too breastfeed and pump. I have tried the Dr. Brown bottles and the Evenflo Ventair bottles and have to say that none of them can even come close to these bottles. I am yet to see one drop of milk drip out of the bottle. Maybe the ladies are not assembling the bottle tops correctly!LOVE THEM!,1

I was very surprised this product worked as well as it did~~~!!! OMG!!! this is amazing stuff! I purchased after reading a review of a trucker that used it and I totally agree that this is a miracle ointment!! more people should know about it! My problem is 80% gone..at least!! it didn't dissapear but it is amazingly gone! Highly recommend!!!,1
"I tried three different variations of TV mounts only to find that, because the manufacturer didn't have the specs you would need on the box, I bought them assuming they would work. Not so. Went to the Sanus website. It's very thorough with regard to measurements, what it will fit, stud space, etc. Bought this one after reading the reviews, had it up on the wall within 15 minutes. It was so easy I kept thinking I did something wrong. But, no, it was just that easy.So if you're in the market for a great mount thats easy to mount, check out Sanus.",1
"This is the original Doodlebops (before being picked up by Disney) but the quality of entertainment for my daughter is the same. Personally I enjoy picking out the differences in costumes, sets and even ears (had them in these episodes but were gone once disney took over), etc. Helps me numb my mind to something I have seen and listened to over and over and over again. :) Overall, great entertainment for my 4 year old.",1
This book is an excellent resource for business students when preparing for case interviews.,1
"Great text, packed with information- very thorough coverage of the topic. I find skimming through it to be difficult because every sentence contains important information; I have to read most chapters twice to get everything out of them. A bit expensive though, you may want to consider getting an international version of the text- it's less than 1/3 the price and contains the very same information.",1
"Anyone who has ever had indigestion, acid stomach/heartburn should read this superb book before spending any money on expensve tablets or liquids. If every doctor read this book, the drug companies would go bust!",1
"James Herriot wrote these amazing books and still today, they ring true with joyous warmth, humor, and sadness. The characters are lively, funny and instantly memorable, and though I first read these books in the late 1970's, they still lift my spirits today. I highly recommend the entire series for anyone who loves animals.",1

"The reviews of all the various editions of the Aeneid seem to be lumped together. I find this odd. Let me clarify that I'm talking about Pharr's edition of the Aeneid, Books I-VI, in Latin, with vocabulary, notes and grammar, currently reprinted by Bolchazy-Carducci. The so-called ""Purple Vergil.""What a beautiful thing! I imagine this book is wonderful for teachers in a Latin classroom setting; I have no idea, as I have never taken a class in Latin. For those who study Latin on their own, like me, this book is absolutely necessary. Each page contains its own textual commentary and also definitions of all but the most common vocabulary words employed on the page. Flipping to the back of the book is minimalized. Vergil becomes easy to read, and his powerful Latin comes through undiminished by translation, however skilled. Buy it today.",1
"This is an easy pizzelle maker to use. They need to be made on the highest number for my taste, but my 85 year old Mother who also used it with ease, lliked them baked on a lower setting. I also like that you have an enclosed measuring spoon so you know exactly how much batter to use. I would recomend this to anyone who has ever even thought about trying these cookies.",1

"I had to read this book this summer for a school assignment. This was a great coming-of-age book in the 1800s. I found it rather interesting. My mom said I'd like it if I liked Little Women (which I totally despised). This story was about a girl named Jane Eyre from when she was in her aunt's orphanage 'till she married. She was abused at her aut's orphange. Soon she went of to Lowood's School for Girls and became a teacher for her last 2 years. She then became a governess at Thornfield after she left school. Soon, she fell in love with the master of the place. Then, she left and became poor and homeless, but then found a job from the person she stayed with and a lot of other things happened, but that's all I'll tell you, because then you won't want to read it.",1
"I've been an Elvis fan from the beginning. His many changes have enriched my life more than I can say. He has explored many genres and shared them with us all. This has been a blessing to me through countless hours of musical enjoyment. This recording is another feather in his cap, and another canon in his musical staple. Outstanding!",1
"Everything about their selection and ordering of the Top 1,000 is debatable, starting with their criteria, but that's the point. The authors are upfront about their thinking, wide-ranging in their selections and thought-provoking in making their cases.

"Released early in 1970, a year or so before their greatest selling LP ""Sonido Bestial"",this LP,""El Diferente"",is one of their great master pieces. Spaning the time between the rhythms of boogaloo, jala-jala,and the infant years of Salsa. Of interest, are the title song, El Diferente (son montuno),the boogaloos:A Jugar Bembe and Ricardo y Chaparro, the guaguancos:Feria En Manizales and Toma Y Dame, and last,but not least, the beautiful bolero from composer Rafael Hernàndez: Cuando Me Digas Que Sì. With the release of this album, these two Salsa greats, got the word out on the streets, that their version of Salsa was truly ""Diferente"".",1
This thin spiral bound book is well-done & I like the choice of songs & the format. The american sign language used is correct. Just wish it had double or ideally triple the amount of songs in it. It arrived in perfect condition & quickly.,1
"It tires me hearing/reading about how ""bad"" WMS is, it really does. There must be some pretty lonely, depressed, down-an-out Cure fans out there who only want music in which to think about suicide to, it's pretty ridiculous. Another thing... no one mentions the track ""Numb."" It's a great song, as is ""Jupiter Crash"" ""Want"" ""Bare"", etc. al. Just b/c WMS doesn't have the line ""Doesn't matter if we all die..."" or ""the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world"", doesn't make it bad. Please, grow up and bring your musical tastes with you.",1
"We should state up front that this is not an impartial book. Author Thomas Siebel, CEO and founder of Siebel Systems, extols the values of ""eBusiness"" (his coinage, apparently), which just happens to be his company's specialty. But at least Siebel Systems - unlike a lot of dot-com companies - has thrived and remained profitable. Siebel contends (arguably based on enlightened self-interest) that companies must either employ new eBusiness tactics or perish. Using profit reports and return-on-investment studies as back-up material, he makes a pretty compelling customer-first argument that we [...] recommend to anyone who's interested in the future of business.",1
"I loved this film and for years have meant to buy it, and I want to own this one so bad that I am buying a multi-region DVD player, so I can buy the Australian or UK version, just to be able to watch it again! That is how good this movie is!It is based on the true story of Phar Lap, a horse picked up by a struggling trainer in Australia, and a horse that then became the best racer in all of Australia, and was so much better than all the competition there, that they took him to the Americas, where there is a very sad, and true to American form, ending.If you like movies that are strong, based on true stories, about horses and racing, and have a really great but sad story, then this is a great movie for you!I highly recomend this one and if I could I would give it 5 and 1/2 stars!",1
"I rate this book ***** five stars because it is about the future, and I like books that try to tell us our possible future. Also I like sci-fi, exciting, and adventurous books a whole lot. The grass on the new planet was like glass it could cut yes cut you!!! There are moth people if you want to find out about them or you are a sci-fi lover ya gotta read this book!",1

"There are many time travel movies floating around out there, but this is one of the better ones.The basic story is a fairly simple one, but the plot and subplots get involved and interesting.A modern aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, gits sucked into some kind of time warp. They find theirselves in the pacific, the dateis Dec. 6th 1941. The day before the Pearle Harbour attack. Now the plot gets interesting. What do they do? With the modernweapons on the Nimitz and exact knowlage of what is about to happen they could decimate the Japanese fleet. But what will happenif they change history? Should they change history? Is it even possible to change history?",1
"It is SO DIFFICULT to find a good Asian Action Figure! Most are either villains or LOOK like villains. Enter Wang Hai. He is an excellent sample of an Asian Action Figure. Does not look ""evil"" nor ""sickly"" as so many others do! His articulation is excellent, his uniform and gear fantastic, guaranteed to look GREAT in your collection or to give HOURS of fun! Thank you Elite Force!",1
The first pair I bought were a bit large and I was pleasantly surprised at how simple Amazon's return and exchange policy was. Now the shoes: They seem to be of excellent quality are comfortable and look good. If you're choosy about which shoes you choose then you should choose these new shoes (now say that fast three times...).,1
This CD is among Buddy Guy's best. About half the songs are done with members of Stevie Ray Vaughn's Double Trouble. All the songs showcase Buddy's classic guitar work.,1
"There are very few authors whose hardcovers I buy on release day. Dana Stabenow is one of the few. A Cold Day For Murder is the book that started my spending spree. It is spare and a little bleak, not unlike the Alaskan landscape that Stabenow so aptly describes. On page 105 of the new hardcover edition, there's a sentence that starts out with the words ""Fourteen months of suffering dark dreams in the dead of night..."" and goes on for about 130 or so more words of positively Joycean length to describe the most horrific event imaginable with such vivid language. I was hooked and continue to be a Stabenow fan to this day. This book won the Edgar for Best PB Original when it was released. It deserved it.",1
"i bouthg this for my mom and she loves it. it smells great!! its a soft, fragrant smell...",1
"The individual pieces in this set balance well in your hands. The knife is very well designed for fitting in your hand while cutting. However, the issue with the knife is that it does not rest on a plate well when not in use. It is an annoyance when the knife falls off your plate repeatedly during a meal. It simply is not balanced or designed to rest on ones plate. This critique is for older flatware.",1
"I got this movie for my son, and he liked it. It isn't his favorite movie, but it is entertaining, and is one of those movies he will watch, and then come back to after a few weeks or months, and that si how a movie should be. One thing though, and perhaps it was the intention of this movie, but it sure does make you feel guilty about eating chicken. :)",1
This book is essential reading for any student of American culture or history. Bercovitch's unigue insight that connects our contemporary culture to our earliest origins will stay with you and illuminate your further reading on any aspect of American life.,1
"Released in early-2000 on the TDI Music label, Edgar and Jerome Froese produced 11 interesting tracks for this motion picture soundtrack. Obviously with Eastern musical influences, the soundscape is mostly meditative, but there is some clubland sparks that smoothly slides into the mix.The elegant Cradle of Prodigies is the standout selection, though the bouncy Meng Tien, along with Zhu Zhanji and Tiger Forest are highly expressive. There is a majestic ambience that flows throughout and it is a solid, stand-alone artistic work.",1
This is Jim Carreys best movie ever. This could be one of the best movies ever. This even beats Ace Ventura. One of the funniest parts is in the car...you wonna hear the most annoying sound ever? haha i love that part. This is a must buy DVD very funny. Better than the new one by far.,1
"A very sturdy bike rake. Easy mounting to car and easy mounting of bike to rack. Drove 1,200 miles round trip with bike and rack on my Silverado truck without any problems. Works great. I like the locks for rack to hitch and bike to rack.",1
"so, first off I'm going to say: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND TURN OFF THE POWER!! my brother was installing the thermostat for me, and didn't read the instructions... so we ended up blowing the transformer. A bit expensive when the whole idea was repalceing the analog t'stat with the digital one. oh well. it works great, just hard to program. I usually don't have trouble, but it doesn't seem to be keeping the changes I put in -goes back to factory original.overall it's great thou :)",1
I say that because he was prominently seen more times than any other wrestler throughout the 3 disc set!I do believe there were other great moments we could have seen that should have been on the disc set or at least additional discs should have been added!This is a sort of great way to reminisce about the year that was & hoping that the Best of Raw 2010 will be even better than 2009!Great purchase for all wrestling fans!,1
I like all of the older Star Trek movies with Leonard Nimoy. This movie brings the 23rd century back home.,1
"Of all the many books I have read on Bruce Lee I think this biography is far and away the best. The previous reviewer reflected my thought exactly, that the author, Bruce Thomas, is ""respectful but not caught up in hero worship"". I would add that this is the only Bruce Lee book I have read that manages to walk that line. Bruce Thomas clearly has a personality and spirituality that is mature enough to have captured and integrated the essence of Bruce Lee. The biography is well-researched and detailed but this is more than a biography...it is a great book.",1
"I love this film. The description does not do it any justice whatsoever. It is very low-budget and understated. Nonetheless, there are some beautiful pictures of geography (beach scenes). Also, the relationship between the two main characters is so tender and real. I envied that.There are some drawbacks:A little too long and choppy plot.The introduction of this character ""Todd"" was very contrived.The two main characters seemed to have difficulties suddenly; we needed more development in that area.",1
"Easy read, relaxing I've enjoyed Wambaugh for many years his insight as a former officer helps him connect to his reader.Several of the situations are recalls or events that occur in and around stations.",1
"This book has made me laugh more than any book I have ever read. I was constantly interrupting my husband's work to say, ""you have to read this."" I would read him bits and he would be cracking up.Every ounce of his commentary on the world around him is just histerical and so true. He can turn even something as tragic as drug abuse into sidesplitting humor. I couldn't pick a favorite chapter because each one is as funny as the last.I plan to pass this book along to all of my friends and family. Anyone with a sense of humor, and even those without one, will fall over laughing.",1
A rush of blood to the head is a rock classic that's all we can say about it!,1
I was a little hesitant at first because of the price.But when i watched the concert i was blown away! I live in Hawaii and Y&T has never had a concert hear in the islands.So the next best thing was to purchase this one of a kind DVD!. Now i have my personal Y&T concert at my beckoning!Thank's to amazon for getting me this wonderful deal!!!! JG,1
"Let me concur with my Swedish colleague and add one thing: The arrangement on ""Living in the Sunlight"" is by one of the true originators and masters of big band arranging, Benny Carter. If you look at the personnel for that one cut, you can see why the album cost Geoff Muldaur a fortune. Truth to tell, Geoff's was the first version of the song I heard, thirty-odd years ago, but I've since heard one by Maurice Chevalier, in which--if I remember correctly--he claims that he ""goes sweemin' with naked weemin!""",1
"If you've never seen this version before, you need a copy of it. I recommend it. We watch it every holiday season.",1
I am so pleased to read that Roseanne season 3 will be coming out to buy in just s few months when season 2 was only just released a month ago. When i was growning up i never enjoyed wathcing Roseanne until a few years ago i was watching re runs of the show and i couldnt stop watching it and i was so excited when it came out to buy on Amazon as i live in Australia and its not available to buy over here. I was also very pleased with the extras on the last disc of season 1 & 2.Thanks for bringing this out and i hope more come out real soon.,1
"I bought this book as a gift for my sixteen month old and hefell in love with it. I also have a five year old that really enjoysit too. When they go to the book shelf they always bring this one back first,and we have to read it two or three times before they go get another book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good children's book.",1
Bought these baskets for a baby shower gift and they were very cute for a nursery. Would buy them again.,1
This was a great buy! The book was almost new condition for a fraction of the price of a new one. Everything was there and couldn't asked for more.,1
I thought the movie would be stupid. But it was so freaking hilarious. And effects were amazing. I loved it. A+,1
"It's about two weeks I'm using it and the quality is really perfect with no noise, it came in an envelope(!!) and arrived in less than a week, it's really worth it and there is no problem with it, most important thing is that the price is so low and there is no extra shipping fee!",1
We used these when we had to put a label on our kids' stuff every day going to daycare. Saved a LOT of time over writing their name on masking tape. Try to remove the label before it gets too wet.,1
"My lab mix can empty a kong in seconds if it is just dry food, even mixed with something sticky. So I thought I would try something else.At first, he was not a fan--barked cause he didn't know how to get food out. I snipped two of the prongs at the bottom and now he loves it.However, now that he is a pro at two prongs--I want the prongs back! =)With prongs, you can't really freeze or put gunk in it (cause good luck trying to clean it!) but without prongs it is basically just a kong.Downside: it is too hard to chew, especially for puppies. Thus my pup uses it more as a treat ball than a chew toy.It is fun to take outside and bounce though. Good quality, not raving about it but glad I bought it. I just bought the large and am keeping the prongs in!",1
"Yep' I had this on vinyl when it came out -70's? SO long ago!! and as previous reviewer says , there is no Katy Kool Lady track on c.d. version .. but a mystery track good tho' it is! . so where IS Katy Kool Lady? All Cale stuff of this period is absolutely fantastic . Cale Fan . DB .",1
"To my surprise, the gate is more substanial than I had suspected. It works perfectly to keep our weiner dog at bay. Works for us!",1
"This album is great, there are many songs on this album that aregreat. This album is nearly a classic album, with hits such asBaba O' Riley, Bargain, Love aint for Keeping, Behind Blue Eyes,& Won't Get Fooled Again. There are many good songs on this albumand if you are new to the Who, you may want this.This album is a must have for any cd collection for any rock fan.",1
"I love this movie!!!!! It's so good, and it's funny. My friends and I sing the songs--especially ""Cool"" and ""Officer Krupke"" all of the time.",1
"More than just a novelty act, The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets have produced an excellent album in Spaceship Zero. Even if the movie never makes an appearance, this is a great concept album, with some cool multi-media extras. Definitely worth a listen!",1
recently bought a 35ft hdmi to hdmi cord online. came up about 5 feet short. i have ton of hdmis sitting at home so why not purchase 2 of these and connect them instead of paying over 15 bucks for 10 more feet of hdmi with the whole hassle of returning themthey work great. i loss no quality or speed... super great product highly recommend.,1
Awesome funny movie...I enjoyed this show with a bunch of friends.it's funny you won't stop laughing from begining to end.I will see it again....get ready for great laughs!!!!,1
"We love using these to bathe our two month old son but they're really expensive!!! We found something similar at Babies R Us (store brand) and they were about $3 per box. They're not as soft as these, but they're still soft and work great. Unfortunately we will not be buying again unless the price comes down. Awesome product, though.",1
"Interesting album. Chester Thompson doing a power organ session just before joining TOP and eventually Santana. He credits this session for his being asked to join TOP. There are some fine moments where you can hear Chester's distinctive approach to the Hammond B3. It's two-track analog sound recorded in basically one take, but if you're a fan of this genius of the organ, you will be very glad to have this album.",1
"The masters may have been cleaned up because the CD I purchased a couple of years ago (2005)sounds great with absolutely no sound quality issues a previous reviewer had problems with. This whole series of ""Americas Greatest Hits"" is a great bargain. Currently there are 12 volumes in the series (Several of which are multi-CD volumes) and all of the ones I have are '5 star'. As of this date Vol. 9 1958 is ""unavailable"". Hopefully it will be available soon.",1
"I like this book, being from Iowa I really liked the twists. I enjoyed the different plots that gave an alternate perspective on what could have possibley happed.",1
"Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds both turn in great performance as CIA operatives. Denzel had gone rogue ten years ago and has a file that will expose many transgressions by the CIA and other agencies worldwide. When Denzel is brought to the Safe House Ryan is in charge of protecting, Ryan finds that escaping with Denzel may be the less evil of the alternatives when the Safe House is breached. Denzel will use any method to escape and Ryan must figure out a way to bring him in alive. The movie is full of action right up to the conclusion when both men must fight for their lifes. If you enjoy the spy genre, this one should be on you list to rent and then quite possibly buy. If you enjoyed this you may enjoy anotherSafe House.CA Luster",1
"This book has changed my life as a parent. When I tell people I don't punish my kids, people think I'm a ""softie"" However, people who see me with my kids understand that I'm really quite strict and that my children are unusually well behved as a result of Dr. Wolf's advice. Dr. Wolf makes you understand that you HAVE to be in charge and that you and your kids will be happier as a result. His methods allow the joy to be brought back into parenting.",1
"I ordered these slip-ons to wear around the house and to take the dog out. They came on time and were as the ad said.good quality,very comfofortable.however because they were slip-on I ordered them a half size smaller than usual but I should have gone a full size smaller.I told the company and they told me to send them back and they would exchange them for me but I decided to keep them any way. I will order more from them later.James Jewkes",1
"By the time ""What Goes On"" was through with me, my eyes were shut, my stomach was up with my lungs, and my tongue was out with my chin. I wiped the drool away and thought, ""I didn't know music could do that.""The guitar. How is that possible? Well, to get technical, Lou's solo was recorded several times, and it came out slightly differently each time, and then the recordings were placed one on top of the other, much like an Andy Warhol silkscreen painting. But I didn't mean how is that technically possible. I meant how is it possible that such a fantastic, blurred, soul-crushing sound exists in this world?Here we are, 43 years later, and nothing approaches it. I know music isn't a competition, but something about this album just seems unfair.",1
"This was an excellent book. I usually preffer something longer, but over all it was pretty good. My english teacher read it to us and most of us loved it, but unfortunately I have to write a book report on it and I am trying to get notes from one of the days I was absent and he's not responding to me!",1
"A linear combination of vectors allows any coefficient - positive or negative. A more powerful concept is the ""cone"" of a set of vectors which allows only positive combinations (more powerful because a linear space is the union of two cones, but a cone can never be expressed as a linear space). While there are many many good books on the ""algebra of linear spaces"" (i.e. Linear Algebra) I havent seen any that treat the ""algebra of cones"" with the thoroughness that this book does. I found this book useful to derive existence proofs in combinatorial optimization although the material is fundamental enough to be applied in many more fields. Best used if you have a reasonably good grasp of linear algebra.",1
"Originally I had bought a tape cassette of Ellis Island while in Ireland many years ago. It wore out, so I looked for a CD...and there's a bonus with this...a DVD. Spectacular...every presentation, whether audio or video/audio! Strong accompaniment comes through clearly on both versions. And I always enjoy applause, especially when I'm driving and can't applaud for them myself. One of the best CD's ever...that's no blarney!",1
"I believe that this book is very good. After all, it's just the way you look at things. Your very own pov and perspective.",1
"This book was about a young boy named Chappie. He lived in a broken down home with his mother and stepfather. his real father lives in Jamaica(which Chappie finds out later on).Chappie ends up getting kicked out of his house and moving in with one of his good friend named Russ. He got kicked out of his house for smoking crack and not coming home. In the house he also lives with a gang of bikers. All they do is stay home, drink, do drugs and ride bikes. They were forced to move out of the house because of a fire. A lot of other stuff happened later on in the book. You should read this book to find out about the rest of the book. I really enjoyes reading the book. Every time I picked it up I never wanted to put it down. All I wanted to do was read.",1
I got this game today really cheap at Target for $24 bucks. I played it for about a hour and the graphics are pretty good. The gameplay is great for ex. when you press the L2 button everything freezes and you can kill people and things like crazy. Characters are good but not enough. You dont spend munch time with different characters. The weopons are okay but could have better selection. I give graphics a A-. Gameplay B+. Characters B-. Weopons B+. If you can find this game really cheap like I did I wouldnt hesitate to buy it. An okay game all around.,1
"This was by far my favorite Bogart movie, had it on vhs but wanted a copy on dvd. The great low price and quick shipping made it a deal, I couldn't pass on.",1
"I first purchased one of these radios a few years ago. Being a bit of a storm geek, I have it set up to bring me alerts from all the counties in my area. I liked it so much I got one for my parents in Florida where they've seen their share of hurricane activity, and they love it. Within the past few months I moved from one place in IL to ""tornado alley"" in IL and my girlfriend is just a mile from me, so I got her one too. She has it set up to receive any local emergencies so she's not bothered by things going on miles away. All and all, these radios work well with their S.A.M.E. technology and mine has been working very well for years now. Could this radio save lives? You bet!",1
"This is a nice, straight forward juicing book that offers some ""extras."" It's simple, but it has an extensive array of recipes and leaves no stone unturned.There's a section on produce that tells the reader what each item is good for (which vitamins and minerals it contains) and how to buy and store them.The ""Juiceman"" also includes a crash course in all the nutrients we need to be healthy, WHAT we need them for, and in which juices we can find them in.At the end of the book, the author includes a Q&A; section and tips and points on how to make juicing an integral part of your life and what to eat to compliment a diet chock full of fresh juices.All in all, this is a great book. It may not appeal to some who are in search of something a little more fancy, with a more complex layout. But, everything considered, it's a sure bet.",1
"I waited for the dvd to come out to watch this Batman movie. I had surgery when it came out and then I waited too because I like to use the captions since, with my hearing impairment, it's easier for me to understand the masked characters with subtitles. I enjoyed the movie and am glad we added it to our collection.",1
"A must read! Teffific novel -- kept my mind whirring through the entire read. Everyone should read this book. It is an eye-opener for anyone, no matter where they are with their spirituality.",1
"This cable is great quality. It is thicker than most cables you get and then ends are much higher quality than the typical molded platic ends on most cables. The price was the best part of the deal, I am very please with this purchase",1
"beautifully done leather shoe from poetic licence!! This shoe does run about a size large, but besides that it's comfy and i can wear it at work all day with just a little soreness at the end of the night..and i stand for almost 8 hours. The footbed isn't super padded, but you can always add an insert if it bothers you. ENJOY- I AM!",1
"This is a really good book, and is one that you can read in a single night. I liked the author's honesty about how the market humbled him before he finally ""made it"". I liked Darvas' technique for boxing stocks and I have been using this technique ever since, but my only complaint is that he didn't go into much detail about how he selected his winning stocks. I wish he had written a chapter on his ""screening process"". If he had, I would've given this book five stars instead of four. It's definitely worth reading though.",1
"This is a wonderful book! I have a copy for myself and I buy one for everyone I know that gets married or for an anniversary. The poetry roams from fun, romantic, sad, to sexy. I would recommend!",1
"A TRUE MASTERPIECE !!!!!!! A mindblowing movie for strong Pink Floyd fans such as myself. A true work of a genious. If you loved the album ""The Wall"", then you will love the movie, It is like listening to the audio C.D. but with images and performances that are simply terrific. A work of art. Check out this movie. Some people say this movie has no sense at all. But THAT is the beauty of it. This movie is DIFFERENT, it is POWERFUL, it is a work of a true GENIOUS and fantastic performances. If you're curious, then it wouldn't hurt watching it. Watch this one. Highly recomended !!!!!!!",1
"This film, if you can believe it, is 20 yrs. old! Normally, one has to make allowances when watching older films, for cultural disconnect and production values, but this film holds ups perfectly after all these years. If it were released today it would be just a popular as it was then. Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy's acting is superb and will go down in history as some of the best performances in film ever. If all that doesn't convince you to check this one out, I don't know what will!",1
"Called by Frederick Benteen, ""My Lie on the Plains"" this is Custer's personal description of his adventures on the Plains. Of necessity it minimizes his Court Martial and other acts of ommission and commission because of Custer's self-view. Notwithstanding this the book gives insights into the psychology of a man who wished to become a legend and did. Any student of Plains History and Custer's part in it, must certainly read the man's own words.",1
"I enjoyed this dvd movie more than when I saw it in the movie theater. VIn Diesel's portrayal of Xander Cage, the anti-hero who saves the world, is effective. Lot's of X-treme action and adventure involved. If you like James Bond movies, you'll like this one (even if the tuxedo wearing spy image was killed early in the movie).I enjoyed the director's comments. I came to realize that there are many things that go into producing and directing in order to create movie magic. Creating these type movies involves dangerous work. His comments added depth and a better understanding of the characters. I appreciate it.",1
"This book is drawn from a series of newspaper columns, and is about as wide-ranging as a gambling book can get. There are basics on how to play the games, blackjack basic strategy, tips on playing the slots, and a fun look at tournament play, with the author actually playing in tournaments and reporting back on the experience and his results. There's also a tear-jerker of an interview with a recovered compulsive gambler. I've read several of this author's books, and they're all browsers' books. Flip open almost anywhere, and you'll find something of interest. They're all also really well written and fun to read.",1
"I have given this book to many people who are going through a health crisis. It speaks universally to the families of loved ones who are going through any sort of chronic illness. If you happen to be a family afflicted by Long QT syndrome, it makes the scientific knowledge of this genetic heart condition easily understood. I have also given this book to my children's teachers and the parents of their friends so that the diagnosis and treatment and day-to-day problems will be more readily understood and not seem as frightening to the adults who are in daily contact with my children.",1
I loved this book. Jordan's Crossing was one of those that you read late in the night to find out what happens. It is really a great book. Randall Arthur is becoming my favorite!,1
"Will have to confess that I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it, 25 years ago! And as long as I'm confessing here, will have to say that ""Flounder's"" my favorite ""Delta""! ""Flounder"" you say? He's a ""legacy from Harrisburg""! You'll laugh (""may I have 10,000 marbles please?""), you'll cry (""what am I going to tell Fred?"") & you'll cheer (""hey Niedermeyer!""). So grab a toga & a brewski (""it don't cost nothing"") & enjoy! And remember, the ""Deltas"" will be dang glad to see 'ya!",1
"Definitely one of the best movies ever seen. Gave Vinnie Jones credibility as an actor and in my opinion, made some people notice Jason Statham. Never short of action and typical Brit humour. One of the defining movies of British cinema",1
"I bought the XBox solely because of halo 2 (I went to a LAN game w/ a few boxes hooked together at my friends and just sat in awe at just how fun that game was/is and basically ended up buying the Box, Halo2, an extra controller, Live and the component hook up cable within a few days - luckily the box had been priced down to $150 by then!) ........ Annnd I plan on buying the xbox360 solely because of Halo 3 - I'm just praying that some sort of price drop will occur before H3 comes out.....if it doesn't I might even have to wait longer because I'm not sure if I want to dish out the amount it costs now.Xbox360 is worth getting for H3 alone.....you can literally play that game 24/7 every day for a few years and not get tired of it (not an over exaggeration!)(that is, you must have Live too.)",1
Works like a charm. I used it for a PATA drive and then my son used it for a SATA drive. Makes upgrading drives a snap.,1
"I am a Louis L'Amour fan, these books from William W. Johnstone are the best westernI have found. Happy they showed up for my kindle. Have bought several, all were reallygood. Do not want paperback, big print would be great but don't think they are inthat format.Am reading Mountain Man 5- Law of the Mountain Man Judy L.",1
The undisputed king of Puerto Rican salsa. This is a great cd. I am Cuban but I grew up in Puerto Rico and this cd is full of tunes that I heard constantly as a teenager in Puerto Rico. I love this cd and if you want another one to complement this one buy Willie Colon & Hector Lavoe's Dejavu they go together in my mind. I love Puerto Rico and this cd makes me feel like I was there. Viva Puerto Rico y viva Hector. Que Dios te tenga en la gloria( God Bless).,1
"This book includes a wonderful collection of material produced by Rommel. The production quality of the text is barely acceptable, but it is readable. I found the material quality high enough to endure the print issue. Could not give it a 5 due to the print quality.",1
"I'm holding on to my third copy of this CD. I put it in the changer whenever we're entertaining and it is purchased by guests willing to pay three times its value after listening to it. Believe me, this CD is that good. It's not only great for entertaining but wonderful for ""stress-relieving""...just sitting and listening to master guitar players at work. A most have if you enjoy smooth, cool, jazz guitar music.",1
"This novel came out of nowhere for me. I expected a short, punchy, satirical comedy-horror novel, and I got an epic. I couldn't believe how gripping it was, and I have no idea what the reviewer below is talking about when he calls it boring. How could you possibly be bored by this? It's not written in a deadpan style, it's dense, lurid, and descriptive, rich with interior monologue, packed with sex and craziness and horror. And those zombies, man--seriously terrifying. I also had no idea what was going to happen--the plot is entirely unpredictable. At one point a character shows up who I thought would be a major character for the rest of novel--and almost immediately gets his head cut off and eaten by zombies. Minor figures who appear in the background become major, crucial players. No one is safe, everyone is important. And remember there's always a price.",1
"Beanie Sigel's ""The Truth"" is a hot album. The first two songs ""The Truth"" and ""Who Want What"" makes you want to keep on listening to the album some more. In ""Who Want What"" Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek switch verses a lot which makes the song tight. The third song ""Raw and Uncut"" is wack. I think it's the worst rap song that I have ever heard. It even has Jay-Z on it. I found the song ""Mac Man"" Ok, but when you get to ""Playa"" it makes you want to play it again and again. It has a tight beat and Beanie Sigel can rhyme on his verse. For the rest of the rest of the songs are alright. For a first album that was pretty good, I can find Sigel rising to the top.",1
"Personally I like Kelly Osbourne alot which is probably one of the reasons I like this album. It's not bad, ""One Word"" is phenomonal and there's a few others that can strike a chord with women who've had some trouble with men (who hasn't) and those who may have had an addiction or two. I have the two previous albums and honestly really like this one much better. The other two were very manufactured and I think even Kelly knew that but when given a shot why the hell not. If you're a fan of Kelly, if you love it when those new wave 80's songs come on the radio then this is all you, if not.....I wouldn't suggest it.",1
"I'm an admitted old-timer. I still use my VCR, and subsequently, I have an old fashioned camcorder. I needed an adapter that allowed meto view my old tapes and relive old memories. I've had an adapter in the past that was easier to use, but the price was right and itdoes the job. However, follow the instructions..when they say close door slowly, they mean slowly.",1
"I bought this hoping it would correct a dirty WQXR signal after the frequency changed and it's worked. I'm close enough to the transmitter that I shouldn't have had a problem, but I did and now I don't.",1
"Words cannot describe this film. It is art. It is a very realview into the all too real and extreme banal realities of life. Weforget of these sometimes, but only because of the beauty we see. American Beauty portrays this on screen perfectly. The director, Sam Mendes, does an excellent job of as well. There could not have been a more real cast for the film also. Kevin Spacey was at his best. He certainly deserved his Academy Award. Anette Benning portrays Carolyn to a tee. Wes Bently was believable. He made us see beauty in our own lives, no matter how cynical they may seem. Other cast members deserve congrats also. Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, Peter Gallagher, Chris Cooper. And how could it all have been done without the touch of Alan Ball's genius. The composed music was in sync with the film perfectly, thanks to Thomas Newman. Extrodinary, and incredible. END",1
"Pros: Very warm for a mid-Atlantic winter, stays in place on a stroller decently well, zips on both sides.Cons: Only zips up to mid-chest on an 8 month old and so a coat and mittens are still needed, would get the toddler size if I had to do it again because my very small 8 month old is almost growing out of the infant size.",1
"I found the Donner cut of Superman II quite interesting. I watched the Lester cut first and then went to the Donner cut. I've always found some of the Zod stuff to be too long in the Lester cut, and i was thankful that some of it was missing in the Donner. I didn't miss the Eifel Tower scene at all, and the alternate revelation of Clark being Supe is actually quite good, even if it is a screen test. The scenes in the Fortress of Solitude are different in places, but no less believable.BUT the 4 stars are because of the ending. I was never wild about the ending when it was used in Supe I, but to reuse it at the end of Supe II (even if it was the original ending) makes no sense. It reverses too much, and the famous diner scene couldn't possibly make sense. It would be even more fun to insplice the best moments from both films and have a super SUPE II, but that won't happen. I'm just glad to have the alternate available.",1
It is such as treat watching an young artist mature they way Avril has. She proved with this record that she is indeed going to be around for dome time.,1
"I generally have a policy of not buying knitting books unseen - it's always a good idea to look before you leap to avoid cluttering your bookshelf with patterns you don't care for or instructions you find unhelpful. I broke that rule for Knitting Vintage Socks, and I'm happy I did. The historical sections are enlightening, the discussions of technique are clear and helpful, and the patterns themselves are interesting and attractive. The simple, elegant lace and color stich motifs featured will hold a knitter's attention without being needlessly complex. I can see myself turning to Knitting Vintage Socks again and again, as will beginning and experienced socknitters alike.",1
"i was so sick of listening to my awesome music through my crappy desktop speakers, so i decided to upgrade. the quality of these speakers is phenomenal, the bass is powerful and the end result is a better experience bother for listening to your music and your gaming experience. these speakers are great for gaming. you can feel the gunsfireand explosions. if you're a bit older and don't like alot of bass, the bass volume on the back of the subwoofer is your best friend. all in all, if your looking to upgrade to quality sound but don't have the space or funds for 5.1 surround speakers, these are topnotch.",1
"I really liked this book because it was so very romantic. Yes, it was flowery and a little cliched but oh for a perfect love like they shared... Helped me reaffirm my belief that love can endure.",1
"Great book in helping women to identify aspects of their relationships that are compulsive and become addictions, mirroring the same affects as drug use.",1
"After getting ""Thomas the tank engine & friends: Sing-Along and Stories"", I needed to find more Thomas songs and purchased this cassette too. Don't know why, but it never caught on as much as the other cassette. It is still very well done, with the accompanying lyrics displayed on the screen and very colorful, but I still have to cast my vote and say that the ""Tank Engine and Friends"" cassette is better.",1
"My name is Dan, from Czech Republic in Europe and I'm 18. I hear Reba 5 years and have all of her albums. Reba is the best, greatest and biggest artist of country music of all time. If You See Him is so good album, but Read My Mind or Starting Over is better. I surprise at new Reba's album.",1
"BROTHER BROTHER BROTHER is an album in which the Isleys soon-to-be platinum 3+3 formula really gels. Ernie, Marvin & Chris made appearances on previous T-Neck albums, but their talents were used to recycle way too many ""It's Your Thing"" riffs. This album blends the right amount of covers (the title track, ""Sweet Season"") and great original material (""Work To Do"", ""Layaway""). The 10 1/2 minute bluesy take on Carole King's ""It's Too Late"" is lively due to Ronald's soaring vocals and Ernie's wailing guitar. And the beautiful closer ""Love Put Me On The Corner"" is perhaps the first great original Isley ballad, and a huge improvement over the insipid ballads on the GET INTO SOMETHING album. BROTHER BROTHER BROTHER gave the Isley Brothers the sound that was used in full effect on their breakthrough album 3+3.",1
Have not taken item out of box yet it is for my grandsons kindergard graduation so I cant write review yet,1
"I bought this for my mom, so I haven't done the exercises myself, but they look really fun and not high impact. Good buy.",1
"These Clear blue Strips is very Easy to use with the ClearBlue Fertility Monitor. I have only used 10 a month, so it does pay for it's self. I would highly recommend this and the monitor if you are trying to conceive. It take's alot of the Guessing out of the month's and alot of women is very suprised, at how they had a lot of there days calculated wrong and now understanding there ovulation day's a little better.",1
"Our daughter loved this play mat. Starting at around a month old, she paid attention to the giraffe and the monkey. As she got older her interest in the other features grew, and she really loved the kick-chimes you can buy as an accessory. The chimes are well worth the extra money -- babies LOVE to kick them (or grab and shake them) and they actually have a very nice, mellow sound. We also grew a bit tired of the music eventually, so we often went without it. The music controller is removable if you don't want to bother with it. Our daughter lost interest in this at around 6 months, when she could sit without assistance, and we put it away by the time she could pull to standing. We plan to roll it back out for the next kiddo, though!",1
"I've had this album for a long time. I listened to it so much, that I had to purchase a new CD recently.This is simply the best of Lifehouse (now that they have 3 albums out). The lyrics are magical. ""Hanging by a Moment"" is not even the best song in the album!",1
"I wrote a review of the above appliance Toastmaster Egg Head Egg Cooker a few minutes ago. Please assure me that my name will not be used in connection with this review. If you intend to use my name, I would like to CANCEL my review of the product. Thank you.Barbara Seibert",1
"While I wouldn't advocate relying on a DVD to replace Red Cross CPR training, it was a perfect refresher for me (trained <5 years ago) and enough to make me feel more comfortable with babysitters after they viewed it. It gives all the necessary steps in a clear (if not a little cheesy) way and is concise enough not to bore you to tears.",1
"I took a chance and ordered this set based on a friend's recommendation. Completely exceeded my expectations. Michael Kitchen is the master of conveying an incredible breadth of emotion/attitude with the nuances of his countenance and very few words. The female supporting character is uniquely interesting -- innocent, decent, adventurous, not especially pretty but attractive, and a little obnoxious. The story lines are well crafted and recall daily life along the coast of England in WWII. I've watched these twice so far, and they were just as engaging the second time through. This set of three discs may be even better than series 1-5, and that is a true compliment.",1
It is so nice and out of the way layiing on the dashbord. Very easy to place on the dashboard.,1
"This is a very cute and romantic movie with great acting. I loved it not just because of the great acting performances by Amy and Matthew, but it is the feeling you get when two people fall in love. The ache in your heart when they depart from each other... and then the expoding climax as they get back together. I've watched this movie on cable like 4 times, and I haven't gotten tired of it because it is so breathtaking to see the beautiful scenery of Ireland. Who cares if it didn't do well in the theatres, I loved it anyway despite anybody who didn't care for it.",1
Great for the price. They glow fairly well after charging for a few minutes. Stars come in two sizes. Largest is about the size of a nickle. The smallest is a little smaller than a dime. I think these sizes are good enough to get as realistic star night ceiling as you can get using plastic stars. Set comes with a little putty to stick up stars. I needed more than came with the pack. Hence why I gave it 4 stars. Overall I think this is a good purchase if you are looking to create a nice simple starry ceiling.,1
"I can not believe how wonderful these desserts taste. It is incredible that no artifical sweetners were added. Not only are these receipes good for our health but, they are low in fat. That is a big plus considering we are always watching our weight. Definitely 5 star all the way!",1
"Excellent old American humor! Taken from supposedly real stories from the Ozarks, and thesurrounding areas. Keep a Kleenex close by, because you will laugh till tears come to youreyes.",1
I really enjoyed watching the movie! It is a very good family film with some good action sequences in it! Overall I think the movie was really good!,1
"...the nasty reptilian burn down the sinuses and back of the throat that came with snorting crystalmeth cut with strych, aspirin, baby-lax and Lord knows what else back in those evil days not as many years ago as I wish... The same malicious synth-drive as Chrome and Six Finger Satellite at their most nefarious moments, and then Lordamighty that voice. Successfully replicates the experience of doing bad drugs with a revival minister suffering the pre-epileptic shoogaloos of amphetameanie-psychosis after several comprehensive ECT sessions in the Solitary ward at Parchman Farm in preparation for a public encounter with the chair. Not even Jeffrey Lee Pierce ever got this bad. If you get your jollies off by driving around in heavy traffic imagining running pedestrians down, this rates just beneath the Stooges for the soundtrack to your sickheaded little fantasies. ELECTRICITY!",1
"Moby Dick may seem daunting at the outset - a huge, rather difficult read - but it is an amazing novel. Stick with it and you will be truly rewarded with a riviting, deeply psychological, and suprising story.",1
"Very engaging dance movie, rough around the edges but worth seeing.nine more words for this review are required, unfortunately.",1
"This is a great album! I just listened to it for the first time. You can infer from the track list that it is pop done up Willie style, but that is not a bad thing. They are all good songs, and this reissue has two bonus tracks that are also excellent. I've seen reviews of this that say it's one of his weaker efforts, but I disagree. (Glad I didn't listen to them!) The arrangements have variety, and are always tasteful and not overdone. The musical details are interesting. Another plus is the backing vocal by Toni Wine (of girl group fame) on ""Permanently Lonely."" If you like pop with great tunes and a sincere heartfelt message, you will love this CD.",1
"I have had my Kindle since Christmas and I dont know what I ever did without it. The screen is amazingly clear and the whispernet feature with basic web access is awesome. I can read all my favorite novels, and update my facebook page all with the same device. I would like to see a larger selection of local newspapers available. The synchronization of the kindle and your amazon.com account is a great feature too. I can see how the kindle or a modified version of it would totally revolutionalize the school system for students. Think of kids not having to carry around all thos big textbooks. Also the uses for industry are apparently limitless also. Manuals, schematics... any publications right on your kindle. Great invention... you bet!!!!!!",1
"I am 40 years old and I LOVE, LOVE this whole series of books! I am always waiting impatiently for the next one to come out to see what happens after the last cliff-hanger. Start with #1 and read all of them. These books get into the hearts and minds of Obi Wan and Qui Gon, and it will get into yours too, whatever your age.",1
"I was so happy to find this book at a reasonable price. This will be a great help with my genealogy. It's a wonderful addition to any library for those interested in Colonial American History, specially Virginia frontier.",1
"At first I wasn't to thrilled to have my English teacher ""force"" me to read this book. I mean look at it. It is about bunny rabits! How stupid! Not! This book changed my whole prespective on books. As soon as i started reading I couldn't put it down. It let me escape from my stress full life to a world full of bunny rabbits. It was like a dream. I was into it from the begining to the end. I cryed at the end. Now if you are thinking about reading this book don't wait stupid read it! Your missing out on one of the worlds greatest novels!",1
"An excellent fantasy story although I didn't think it was as good as the previous three. My primary objection is that Richard, Kahlan et. al are perpetually behind the eight ball. The last two books seem obsessed with telling us how powerful Richard is, but he has learned almost nothing about his abilities. The heroism through ignorance theme is starting to wear a little thin. It would be something if Richard was learning more about his abilities as time went by, but the only thing Richard seems to be able to do is ""pull the rabbit out of the hat"" but only when he has absolutely no other choice. Despite this it is still very fun to read.",1
"Folks, if you are looking for songwriting brilliance than please check out this release. There is no person recording today who has any talent remotely close to her and I am certain you'll not regret buying both of her recordings. What can I say? My wife is Brazilian and loves her work...I came of age with REM and Echo and the Bunnymen and I love her stuff too. Buy her recordings. You will not regret it...unless you have no taste in music.",1
"I'm impressed, I had the original CD version previously and the vinyl...Hear music did everything fantastic in this version...the sound is full, wide...i'm hearing sounds i didn't hear before sharpness i didn't hear before with clarity...also i want to state i didn't hear one bit of distortion (not that mccartney I ever got loud) but there were times it got loud eg the crescendo on maybe i'm amazed it gets loud and no distortion...also i will say this sounds like it could've been recorded in 2010 meaning it sounds modern and there's nothing by way of limitations and most important it makes this album (cd) a real pleasure to listen to as I hope to listen to it again in a day or so and that's the important aspect to buying a cd...to be brief this album is total heaven...i hope heaven is at least 1/2 as good as this album is...can't wait to hear more releases from hear music in the series.",1
"If you liked Baby One More Time, then you definitely will not be disappointed with this album. Britney returns with her enthusiam and energy in 12 new songs. For once, I finally have found a cd in which I like EVERY song in it. Some of her songs are better than others, but all are fun and/or relaxing to listen to. If there's anything wrong with this cd, its that there's no song that matches my favorite, Sometimes. However, all I think that means is that a song that excellent cannot be topped, thus that should not be held against this album.My favorite songs on this album are tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, and 12. However, the others are also pleasant to listen to, and should not be scorned upon.Overall, if you like Britney Spears, then you should get this album immediately. If not, then you should stop believing all the silly rumors and actually sit down and listen to her songs in their entirety. If you don't then you really don't know what you're missing.",1

One gets weary of WW2 novels but this was clever. Young man meets an older lady and has a relationship that becomes part of his life and hers. Fast forward and back and the tale is complete. She is constant through their relationship. He waffles and stays close. His connection keeps him from developing as an adult male. She completes her journey through life. The main concern is that his voice never changes much as he grows older. She stays consistant.,1
"I know,I know. Everyone is whining that she doesn't write her own songs. Neither does Whitney Houston or Celine Dion! The only divas I can think of off hand that do are Mariah Carey and Madonna(and they just co-write.)It's a pop album! Give her break and I must say,it's entertaining. The title track ""Oops!I Did It Again"" is probably one of the catchiest songs ever to hit radio and the cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"" could have been a lot worse. So,if you're planning to buy this,you might want to change your mind depending on taste,but I say,go for it. But,if you want a REALLY good pop album that can appeal to all ages,I say the Backstreet Boys' Millenium. In my opinion,Millenium is one of the best pop CDs to hit the market.",1
"I picked this book up because it was 20% off; I'd never heard of it or Ms. Goonan. It was a great find. Ms. Goonan is current on all of the cutting edge science - cloning, genetic manipulation, nanotech, and even the cutting edge super-string theory of physics, which implies the possibility of time travel. All of this could be incredibly boring, though, but Ms. Goonan hangs it all on a great plot populated by some memorable characters. The novel is set in Hawaii. Some of the characters are native Hawaiians, and members of the underground Homeland Movement; another is the Japanese daughter of the founder of Interspace, an organization with the lofty goal of settling the stars, but as corrupt and underhanded as any modern organization. The way all of these elements are tied together is really incredible. You'll have to read it to see for yourself",1
"For me, Rufus was not an acquired taste - I loved his voice and his songs the first time I heard them a little less than a year ago. In fact, I literally listened to nothing else for a month after buying the CD, and I still play it several times a week. My only complaint is that I've been waiting a year for his second CD! In today's fragmented music scene, I suppose it's not surprising to see the negative reviews on this page. I'm sure they don't understand my enthusiasm any more than I understand their disdain. I'd suggest that anyone who was interested enough to come to this page should give Rufus a listen, because if you like his stuff at all there's a good chance he'll become a favorite, as he has for me.",1
This is just down right AWSOME. This is a CD you play loud and repeatedly. Totally enjoy the song and the remix's are a blast.,1
I got my dog microchipped when he was neutered and figured I wouldn't need the yearly subscription but decided to go for it anyways. They provide you with free calls to ASPCA vets 24/7 if there's anything wrong with your pet. I will continue to renew for piece of mind! I called last night and they gave great service and it made me feel so much better after talking to a vet and finding out what signs to look for to make sure the problem would resolve.,1
We could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Meant for families who love to laugh together.,1
The Basketball Diaries is sad because it's honest. It's gripping because it's real. I recommend this book that captures the life of talent gone to waste through the fall of addiction. Although it's not one of my all-time reads - you won't be dissapointed that you picked it up.,1
"An excellent book, straight from the heart.The only reason why it is not more stars from me, is that it is very very short.",1
"I purchased my Kindle after seeing it on Oprah, and I am very very pleased with it.Being older , I was having difficulty reading, even large print books, but the Kindle is so clear, and has adjustable text size that is easier to read then regular books or magazines, and no need to worry about storage.Browsing books, and ordering is so simple, amazing machine! Also book pricing is much cheaper then other EBooks. Love Love Love my Kindle.",1
"As my mixed playlist drove through five ace songs from this CD once again, and as I looked up for the fiftieth time to see who was playing such nice crunchy guitars, I realized that I hadn't given much thought to where this music came from and what happened to them. Sure, as others point out, they stole everything, an entire band a song, but who doesn't? Shoot, other groups like Coldplay are pure derivative, and I have more songs off ""Million"" than I do ""X&Y;"" on my playlists.So, where did they go? Zero Wiki entry, the website is some shopping spam and Google comes up nearly empty. Mike Thrasher is apparently still in the biz as a promoter in Oregon, but still, in terms of profile vs. quality, this has to rank way up there for lack of notice. Heck, it was only 7 years ago, how could you be this solid and be gone? Ah well, past time for a reminder of how good this album was. Check it out.",1
Item was received very quickly by mail and as described. Had looked locally and was unable to find anywhere.,1
The product was easy to install (wrench was the only tool needed) and provides the family with noticeable chemical free filtered water.,1
"Absolutely wonderful telling of a hopeful tale of the meaning and future of family. No Pablum here, but neither is meaning hidden. Seldom have I read a story so elegantly written.I would recommend this book to anyone.",1
"Nerve Gas Tragedy was formed by the four remaining members of the legendary metal/ hardcore band All Out War when vocalist and founding member Mike Score abandoned them in the spring of 2004. Wasting no time, they recruited vocalist Will Kummerer and Nerve Gas Tragedy was born. Nerve Gas Tragedys music combines the speed of 1980s thrash, (Testament, Kreator and Slayer) with the pummeling riffs of 1990s hardcore, (Blood For Blood, Hatebreed and Merauder) and the dark, evil sounds of European death metal . (At The Gates, Carcass, Bolt Thrower) The combination of these sounds makes Nerve Gas Tragedy appeal to fans of all of the aforementioned styles as well as fans of the metal and hardcore bands of today.[...].",1
I think that this was a good cd and i love to dance and sing to it.I'm going to her concert in July and I can't wait! I hope everybody gets it and enjoys it.,1
"I first owned this on vinyl, then on tape, now on CD. It is totally excellent! Some songs may seem dated, such as ""Russians"" which deals with the tensions that existed between the U.S. and Russian in the Regan Whitehouse era, but it's still a haunting reminder of the threat of nuclear warfare...while the song ""A Children's Crusade"" further exacerbates the tension of the effect of war on the innocent. This disc rocks... you can listen to it front to back, over and over again. If you're a fan of Dave Matthews, you'll hear some familiar sounds in ""The Dream of the Blue Turtles"" and ""Consider Me Gone."" An excellent collection of work.",1
