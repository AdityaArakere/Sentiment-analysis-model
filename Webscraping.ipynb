Bowling to the leftie was hard but the more I keep it tight, it is better. I had it in my mind to keep it simple. Just bowl the right areas consistently. Batting is all about time spent in the nets. The kind of opportunity and confidence in me by the coaching staff and the captain does give me a lot of batting time in the nets. It helps me in the middle.\"\n",

Hardik Pandya says: \"I am obviously very happy, but we did put ourselves in a difficult position. We were very happy with 178 because at one point they looked like going past 200. But we kept getting wickets. Having the impact rule makes my job very difficult. There are too many options. Because of it, someone will always bowl less or late. My shot and Shubman's shot put the team in a difficult position. We have some standards inside the dressing room. We have to finish the games, and not Rash and Rahul all the time.\"\n",

Also it was a 7.30pm start so the ball holds on a little early on. Also we could have batted properly in the middle overs as opposed to trying to muscle the ball. Rutu is a pleasure to watch. He has groomed himself very well, and makes the eight decisions under pressure. We can't afford to bowl no-balls. That is something in our control.\"\n",

      "Commentary Text: 11.38pm That's a pretty comfortable win for the defending champions, GT. Led by Rashid Khan with the ball, they restricted CSL to 20 short of a par score, and then chased it down fairly easily. In the end, two blows from Rashid Khan turned a possibly tight finish to a walk in the park in the last over. The win will be extra sweet because they couldn't use their Impact Player properly thanks to the injury to Kane Williamson when fielding. The pace of the match hasn't been great with more than four hours taken\n",
